<h2 id="midnight-tides-prologue">Midnight Tides, Prologue</h2>
<p><em>Andarist, who long ago surrendered his power in answer to a grief that could never heal. All unknowing that the hand that delivered that grief was mine…</em></p>
<p><em>Anomandaris Irake, who broke with his mother and with his kind. Who then vanished before I could deal with him. Vanished, probably never to be seen again.</em></p>
<p><em>And now Silchas Ruin, who in a very short time will know the eternal prison of the Azath.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-bonehunters-chapter-16">The Bonehunters, Chapter 16</h2>
<p>The narrative began at the end furthest from the throne. Three figures against a midnight background. Three brothers, born in pure Darkness and most cherished by their mother. All cast out, now, although each had come to that in his own time. Andarist, whom she saw as the first betrayer, an accusation all knew was mistaken, yet the knot of falsehoods had closed tight round him and none could pry it loose except Andarist himself – and that he could or would not do. Filled with unbearable grief, he had accepted his banishment, making his final words these: welcome or not, he would continue his guardianship of Mother Dark, in isolation, and in this would be found the measure of his life. Yet even to that promise, she had turned away. His brothers could not but recognize the crime of this, and it was Anomandaris Purake who was first to confront Mother Dark. What words passed between them only they knew, although the dire consequence was witnessed by all – Anomander turned his back on her. He walked away, denying the Darkness in his blood and seeking out, in its stead, the Chaos that ever warred in his veins. Silchas Ruin, the most enigmatic of the brothers, had seemed a man riven by indecision, trapped by impossible efforts at mitigation, at reconciliation, until all constraint was sundered, and so he committed the greatest crime of all. <em>Alliance with Shadow. Even as war broke out among the Tiste – a war that continues unchecked to this day.</em></p>
<p>There had been victories, defeats, great slaughters, then, in that final gesture of despair, Silchas Ruin and his followers joined with the legions of Shadow and their cruel commander Scabandari – who would come to be known as Bloodeye – in their flight through the gates. <em>To this world. But betrayal ever haunts those three brothers.</em> And so, in the moment of supreme victory against the K’Chain Che’Malle, Silchas Ruin had fallen to Scabandari’s knife, and his followers had in turn fallen to Tiste Edur swords.</p>

<h2 id="reapers-gale-chapter-8">Reaper&rsquo;s Gale, Chapter 8</h2>
<p>(饿者注：我不知道如何形容这段的可嗑性，我只是觉得好像能嗑)</p>
<p>Clip rose to his feet, then began his descent to the Disc of Concordance. The chain and its rings appeared in his hand, whirring, then snapping, then whirring out again.</p>
<p>‘He is Anomander’s Mortal Sword?’ Silchas Ruin asked in obvious disbelief as he stared up at this meeting’s audience of one.</p>
<p>Clip smiled. ‘Do you think he would be displeased?’</p>
<p>After a moment, the brother of Rake grimaced, then shook his head. ‘Probably not.’</p>
<p>‘Come the morrow,’ Ordant Brid said, ‘we will begin preparing the way for the continuation of your journey.’</p>
<p>Reaching the edge of the lowest tier, Clip dropped lightly onto the polished stone of the Disc, then approached Silchas Ruin, the chain in his hand spinning and clacking.</p>
<p>‘Must you always do that?’ Silchas Ruin demanded.</p>
<p>‘Do what?’</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin walked into the chamber, followed a moment later by the Tiste Andii, Clip.</p>
<p>Seren Pedac felt a sudden chill, although she could not determine its source. Clip was smiling, but it was a cynical smile, and it seemed his eyes held steady on Fear Sengar, as if awaiting some kind of challenge.</p>
<p>‘Acquitor,’ said Silchas Ruin, releasing the clasp of his cloak as he walked over to the stone table against a far wall, where waited wine and food, ‘at least one mystery has been answered.’</p>
<p>‘Oh?’</p>
<p>‘The preponderance of wraiths here in the Andara, the countless ghosts of dead Tiste Andii – I know why they are here.’</p>
<p>‘I am sorry, I did not know this place was crowded with wraiths. I’ve not even seen Wither lately.’</p>
<p>He glanced across at her, then poured himself a goblet of wine. ‘It is extraordinary,’ he murmured, ‘how something as basic as the absence of a taste on the tongue can prove the most excruciating torture…when one is buried for thousands of years.’</p>
<p>She watched him take a mouthful of the watery wine, watched him savour it. Then he said, ‘Time, Acquitor. The Omtose Phellack ritual, which froze all in place, defied Hood himself – apologies, Hood is the Lord of Death. The ghosts – they had nowhere to go. Easily captured and enslaved by the Tiste Edur, but many others managed to evade that fate, and they are here, among their mortal kin. The Onyx Wizards speak of compassion and balance, you see…’</p>
<p>No, I do not, but I think that is of no matter. ‘Will the wizards help us?’</p>
<p>A wry grimace from Silchas Ruin, then he shrugged. ‘Our fell party now has a new member, Acquitor, who is charged with guiding us to what we seek.’</p>

<p><em>And how did you fare in Letheras, Silchas Ruin? Not well, I’d wager.</em></p>
<p><em>You’re not your brother. You never were.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, Anomander Rake, we will find you. And you will give answer to us. No, not even a god can blithely walk away, can escape the consequences. Of betrayal.</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, we will find you. And we will show you. We will show you just how it feels.</em></p>

<h2 id="toll-the-hounds-chapter-8">Toll the Hounds, Chapter 8</h2>
<p>The night just past Endest Silann, making his way to a back storeroom on the upper level, came upon the Son of Darkness in a corridor. Some human, thinking the deed one of honour, had hung a series of ancient Andii tapestries down both walls of the passage. Scenes of Kharkanas, and one indeed showing Dorssan Ryl – although none would know if not familiar with that particular vantage point, for the river was but a dark slash, a talon curled round the city’s heart. There was no particular order, arrayed so in ignorance, and to walk this corridor was to be struck by a collage of images, distinct as memories not one tethered to the next.</p>
<p>Anomander Rake had been standing before one, his eyes a deep shade of amber. Predatory, fixed as a lion’s before a killing charge. On the faded tapestry a figure stood tall amidst carnage. The bodies tumbled before him all bled from wounds to the back. Nothing subtle here, the weaver’s outrage dripped from every thread. White-skinned, onyx-eyed, sweat-blackened hair braided like hanging ropes. Slick swords in his hands, he looked out upon the viewer, defiant and cold. In the wracked sky behind him wheeled Locqui Wyval with women’s heads, their mouths open in screams almost audible.</p>
<p>‘He did not mean it,’ said Anomander Rake.</p>
<p>But he did. ‘Your ability to forgive far surpasses mine, Lord.’</p>
<p>‘The body follows the head, but sometimes it’s the other way round. There was a cabal. Ambitious, hungry. They used him, Endest, they used him badly.’</p>
<p>‘They paid for it, didn’t they?’</p>
<p>‘We all did, old friend.’</p>
<p>Endest Silann looked away. ‘I so dislike this hallway, Lord. When I must walk it, I look neither left nor right.’</p>
<p>Rake grunted. ‘It is indeed a gauntlet of recrimination.’</p>
<p>‘Reminders, Lord, of the fact that some things never change.’</p>
<p>‘You must wrest yourself loose, Endest. This despondency can…ravage the soul.’</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toll-the-hounds-chapter-12">Toll the Hounds, Chapter 12</h2>
<p>(饿者注：Endest 独白，正传罕见的同框)</p>
<p>The stately trees with their black trunks and midnight leaves formed a rough ring encircling Suruth Common. From the centre of the vast clearing, one could, upon facing north, see the towers of the Citadel, their slim lines echoing these sacred trees. Autumn had arrived, and the air was filled with the drifting filaments from the blackwood.</p>
<p>The great forges to the west lit crimson the foul clouds hanging over them, so that it seemed that one side of Kharkanas was ablaze. An eternal rain of ash plagued the massive, sprawling factories, nothing as sweet as the curled filaments to mark the coming of the cold season.</p>
<p>Within the refuge of Suruth Common, the blasted realm of the factories seemed worlds away. Thick beds of moss cloaked the pavestones of the clearing, muting Endest Silann’s boots as he walked to the concave altar stone at the very heart. He could see no one else about – this was not the season for festivity. This was not a time for celebration of any sort. He wondered if the trees sensed him, if they were capable of focusing some kind of attention upon him, made aware by the eddies of air, the exudation of heat and breath.</p>
<p>He had read once a scholar’s treatise describing the chemical relationship between plants and animals. The language had been clinical in the fashion of such academic efforts, and yet Endest recalled closing the book and sitting back in his chair. The notion that he could walk up to a plant, a tree, even a blackwood, and bless it with his own breath – a gift of lung-soured air that could enliven that tree, that could in truth deliver health and vigour, deliver life itself…ah, but that was a wonder indeed, one that, for a time, calmed the churning maelstrom that was a young man’s soul.</p>
<p>So long ago, now, and he felt, at times, that he was done with giving gifts.</p>
<p>He stood alone in front of the ancient altar. The past night’s modest rain had formed a shallow pool in the cup of the basalt. It was said the Andii came from the forests and their natural clearings, born to give breath to the sacred wood, and that the first fall of his people occurred the moment they walked out, to set down the first shaped stone of this city.</p>
<p>How many failings had there been since? Suruth Common was the last fragment of the old forest left in all Kharkanas. Blackwood itself had fed the great forges.</p>
<p>He had no desire to look westward. More than the fiery glow disturbed him. The frenzy in those factories – they were making weapons. Armour. They were readying for war.</p>
<p>He had been sent here by the High Priestess. ‘Witness,’ she had said. And so he would. The eyes of the Temple, the priesthood, must remain open, aware, missing nothing in these fraught times. That she had chosen him over others – or even herself – was not a measure of respect. His presence was political, his modest rank a deliberate expression of the Temple’s contempt.</p>
<p>‘Witness, Endest Silann. But remain silent. You are a presence, do you understand?’</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>They appeared almost simultaneously, one from the north, one from the east and one from the south. Three brothers. Three sons. This was to be a meeting of blood and yes, they would resent him, for he did not belong. Indeed, the Temple did not belong. Would they send him away?</p>
<p>The trees wept their promise of a new season of life – a season that would never come, for there was nowhere left for the filaments to take root – not for scores of leagues in any direction. The river would take millions, but even those fine black threads could not float on its waters, and so what the river took the river kept, buried in the dead silts of Dorssan Ryl. Our breath was meant to give life, not take it away. Our breath was a gift, and in that gift the blackwood found betrayal.</p>
<p>This was and is our crime, and it was and remains unforgivable.</p>
<p>‘Good evening, priest,’ said Andarist, who then added, ‘Anomander, it seems you were right.’</p>
<p>‘An easy prediction,’ Anomander replied. ‘The Temple watches me the way a rove of rhotes watch a dying ginaf.’</p>
<p>Endest blinked. The last wild ginaf had vanished a century past and no longer did the silver-backed herds thunder across the south plains; and these days roves of rhotes winged above battlefields and nowhere else – and no, they did not starve. Are you the last, Lord? Is this what you are saying? Mother bless me, I never know what you are saying. No one does. We share language but not meaning.</p>
<p>The third brother was silent, his red eyes fixed upon the forges beneath the western sky.</p>
<p>‘The clash between Drethdenan and Vanut Degalla draws to an end,’ said Andarist. ‘It may be time—’</p>
<p>‘Should we be speaking of this?’ Silchas Ruin cut in, finally turning to face Endest Silann. ‘None of this is for the Temple. Especially not some pathetic third level acolyte.’</p>
<p>Anomander seemed uninterested in settling his attention upon Endest Silann. In the face of his brother’s belligerence, he shrugged. ‘This way, Silchas, perhaps we can ensure the Temple remains…neutral.’</p>
<p>‘By unveiling to it all that we intend? Why should the Temple hold to any particular faith in us? What makes the three of us more worthy of trust than, say, Manalle, or Hish Tulla?’</p>
<p>‘There is an obvious answer to that,’ said Andarist. ‘Priest?’</p>
<p>He could refuse a reply. He could feign ignorance. He was naught but a third level acolyte, after all. Instead, he said, ‘You three are not standing here trying to kill each other.’</p>
<p>Andarist smiled at Silchas Ruin.</p>
<p>Who scowled and looked away once again.</p>
<p>‘We have things to discuss,’ said Anomander. ‘Andarist?’</p>
<p>‘I have already sent representatives to both camps. An offer to mediate. Veiled hints of potential alliances against the rest of you. The key will be in getting Drethdenan and Vanut into the same room, weapons sheathed.’</p>
<p>‘Silchas?’</p>
<p>‘Both Hish and Manalle have agreed to our pact. Manalle still worries me, brothers. She is no fool—’</p>
<p>‘And Hish is?’ laughed Andarist – a maddeningly easy laugh, given the treachery they were discussing.</p>
<p>‘Hish Tulla is not subtle. Her desires are plain. It is as they all say: she does not lie. No, Manalle is suspicious. After all, I am speaking of the greatest crime of all, the spilling of kin’s blood.’ He paused, then faced Anomander, and suddenly his expression was transformed. Unease, something bewildered and lit with horror. ‘Anomander,’ he whispered, ‘what are we doing?’</p>
<p>Anomander’s features hardened. ‘We are strong enough to survive this. You will see.’ Then he looked at Andarist. ‘The one who will break our hearts stands before us. Andarist, who chooses to turn away.’</p>
<p>‘A choice, was it?’ At the heavy silence that followed, he laughed again. ‘Yes, it was. One of us…it must be, at least one of us, and I have no desire to walk your path. I have not the courage for such a thing. The courage, and the…cruel madness. No, brothers, mine is the easiest task – I am to do nothing.’</p>
<p>‘Until I betray you,’ said Silchas, and Endest was shocked to see the white-skinned Lord’s wet eyes.</p>
<p>‘There is no other way through,’ said Andarist.</p>
<p>Centuries into millennia, Endest Silann would wonder – and never truly know – if all that followed was as these three had planned. Courage, Andarist had called it. And…cruel madness – by the Mother, yes – such destruction, the sheer audacity of the treachery – could they have meant all of that?</p>
<p>The next time Anomander had met Endest Silann had been on the bridge at the foot of the Citadel, and in his words he made it clear that he had not recognized him as the same man as the one sent to witness his meeting with his brothers. A strange carelessness for one such as Anomander. Although, unquestionably, the Lord had other things on his mind at that moment.</p>
<p>Endest Silann had delivered to the High Priestess his account of that fell meeting. And in relating the details of the betrayal, such as could be culled from what he had heard – all the implications – he had expected to see outrage in her face. Instead – and, he would think later, with prescient symbolism – she had but turned away.</p>
<p>There had been no storms in the sky then. Nothing to hint of what would come. The blackwood trees of Suruth Common had lived for two millennia, maybe longer, and each season they shed their elongated seeds to the wind. Yet, when next he looked upon those stately trees, they would be on fire.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dust-of-dreams-chapter-20">Dust of Dreams, Chapter 20</h2>
<p>At her outburst, Silchas frowned. ‘Speak what you are hiding, bonecaster.’</p>
<p>‘Gesture for gesture? Very well. Errastas has summoned the Elders. Sechul Lath, Kilmandaros, Mael—and now Draconus—yes! When you hide yourselves so well you yield your touch on this trembling world—you become blind. Your brother is dead, Silchas Ruin. Dragnipur is shattered. Draconus is loose upon the realm, Darkness in his hands—and what does his old lover see now that she sets eyes upon us all once more? Have you greeted your mother yet, Silchas? Have you felt her touch upon your brow? I thought not. She grieves for the son she cherished the most, I think. In whom the black flames of her love burned brightest. She reserves true spite and contempt for—’</p>
<p>Torrent’s backhanded swing caught her full in the face, hard enough to knock her from her feet, falling in a clatter of bones. As he loomed over her, he found he’d drawn his sword. ‘Spite, witch? Well, you’d know of it better than anyone. Now shut that bony jaw and keep it shut.’</p>
<p>Her black pitted eyes seemed to fix upon his own as if bearing claws, but he did not flinch. Destruction? You scrawny bitch, I fear only its escape. He stepped back and shot Silchas a glance.</p>
<p>The man looked so wounded it was a wonder he was still standing. He had wrapped his arms about his own torso, curled in and shrunken. The liquid that leaked down from his eyes traced crimson glints down his hollowed cheeks. Torrent saw Ryadd, his face ravaged with distress, take a step towards his companion, and then he wheeled to advance on Olar Ethil.</p>
<p>Torrent stepped into his path. ‘Go back,’ he said. ‘Now is not the time. Console your friend, Ryadd. I will lead her away from here.’</p>
<p>The young warrior trembled, his eyes incandescent with fury. ‘She will not—’</p>
<p>‘Heed me? She will. Ryadd, the attacks are over—’</p>
<p>He started, eyes widening. ‘Attacks.’ Then he nodded. ‘Yes, I see. Yes.’ He nodded again, and then turned round, ready to give his youthful strength to an old man suddenly broken.</p>
<p><em>And so he surpasses, and leadership now belongs to him. Simple as that.</em> Torrent sheathed his sword and swung up on to his horse. He gathered the reins, shot one last withering look upon Olar Ethil—who’d yet to move—and then kicked his mount into motion.</p>
<p>On to the trail of the wagon, east and south. He did not look back, but after a time he saw a spinning cloud of dust lift from a nearby rise. She was with him. I see you, sweet as crotch rot, but will you even admit I probably just saved your sorry sack?</p>
<p>Didn’t think so.</p>
<p>As the sun painted gold the brutal facing of the stone tower, a figure of gold and bronze stood above another who knelt, bowed forward over his thighs with his face in his hands.</p>
<p>Neither moved until long after the sun set and darkness claimed the sky.</p>

<p><em>Mother, how could you have lived with this? For so long? No wonder you went mad. No wonder you all did.</em> He glanced over at Silchas Ruin, but the figure had not moved. <em>How much longer?</em> he wanted to ask. Still…the Tiste Andii needed no further invitation to view him as little more than a child. A child of terrible power, true, but still a child.</p>
<p>And, Rud allowed, he would not be far wrong, would he? There was no sense to what they intended to do. So much was out of their hands. They hovered like swords, but whose gauntleted grasp would close on them when the time came? There didn’t seem to be an answer to that question, at least not one Silchas Ruin was willing to share.</p>
<p>And what of this Tiste Andii, standing there as if carved from alabaster, rubies for eyes, moaning blades crossing his back? He had lost his last surviving brother. He was utterly alone, bereft. Olar Ethil had broken him for no purpose Rud could see, barring that of spite. But Silchas Ruin had finally straightened, biting on that wound in the manner of a speared wolf, and he’d been limping ever since – at least in his sembled state. It was quite possible – and indeed likely – that Silchas Ruin preferred to remain in an Eleint form, if only to cauterize the pain with the soulfire of chaos. Yet there he stood. <em>Because I am too weak to resist. Draconean ambitions taste bitter as poison. They want my surrender, they want to hear me howl with desire.</em></p>
<p>‘Once we find a cave,’ resumed Silchas Ruin, ‘I will leave you for a time. Those stone weapons of yours are insufficient for what comes. While it is true that we may have no need for swords and the like, I believe it is time for you to take to hand a proper blade.’</p>
<p>‘You want to go and find me a sword.’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘And where do you look for something like that?’ Rud asked. ‘A weaponsmith’s in Letheras? A trader’s camp near a recent battlefield?’</p>
<p>‘None of those,’ he replied. ‘For you, I have something more ambitious in mind.’</p>
<p>Rud’s gaze returned to the flames. ‘How long will you be gone?’</p>
<p>‘Not long, I should think.’</p>
<p>‘Well then,’ Rud snapped, ‘what are you waiting for? I can find my own cave.’</p>
<p>He felt Silchas Ruin’s regard upon him, and then it was gone and when he turned, so was the Tiste Andii – he had plummeted from the ledge. Moments later a buffet of wind struck him, and he saw the dragon lifting skyward, up above the ravaged peaks, blotting out stars.</p>
<p>‘Ah, Silchas, I am sorry.’</p>

<h2 id="the-crippled-god-chapter-8">The Crippled God, Chapter 8</h2>
<p>‘Your brother slew our strongest ally.’</p>
<p>‘He did? And of what significance is that to me, Beru?’</p>
<p>‘You are as infuriating as he was! May you share his fate!’</p>
<p>‘We shall all share his fate,’ Silchas Ruin replied.</p>
<p>Shadowthrone giggled. ‘I have found you a weapon, but only if the one who wields it is worthy.’</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin looked round. ‘From this place?’</p>
<p>‘No, not from here. There is nothing to the weapons here but memories of failure.’ A sword appeared from the shadows swirling round the god and clattered at the Tiste Andii’s feet.</p>
<p>Looking down, he drew a sharp breath. ‘Where did you come by this?’</p>
<p>‘Recognize it?’</p>
<p>‘A Hust…but no.’ He hesitated. ‘I feel that I should, knowing well that sacred forge. The draconic theme is…distinctive. But the ferrules remind me of Hust’s earliest period of manufacture, and I thought I knew all of those so made. Where did you come by this?’</p>
<p>‘Of little relevance, Prince. You note the draconic theme, do you? What is the term? Pattern weld? So you might think, to see those scales glittering so prettily along the length of the blade.’ He giggled. ‘So you might think.’</p>
<p>‘This weapon is too good for the one I intended to arm.’</p>
<p>‘Indeed? How…unfortunate. Perhaps you could convince your friend to take the ones you now wield? And for yourself, this singular weapon. Consider it a gift to you, from Shadowthrone.’</p>
<p>‘And why should you so gift me?’ Silchas Ruin asked.</p>
<p>‘Perhaps the others here bemoan the loss of Hood. I do not. He was hoary and humourless, and ugly besides. Thus. If I cannot convey my best wishes to Hood’s noble slayer, then his brother shall have to do.’</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin looked back down at the Hust sword. ‘When we were children,’ he muttered, ‘he used to steal my things all the time, because he liked to see me lose my temper.’ He paused, remembering, and then sighed. ‘Even then, he was fearless.’</p>
<p>Shadowthrone was silent. The other gods simply watched.</p>
<p>‘And then,’ Silchas Ruin whispered, ‘he stole my grief. And now, what is there, I wonder…what is there left to feel?’</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-crippled-god-chapter-14">The Crippled God, Chapter 14</h2>
<p>(这段可以理解为 Silchas&amp;Rud Elalle，将就一下)</p>
<p>‘Is it Olar Ethil?’(饿者注：是 DoD 选段里那个声称 Rake 死了的人)</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin frowned. ‘What?’</p>
<p>‘Is she the one you’re going to kill, Silchas Ruin?’</p>
<p>‘Why would I do that?’</p>
<p>‘For what she said.’</p>
<p>‘She spoke the truth, Ryadd.’</p>
<p>‘She hurt you. On purpose.’</p>
<p>He shrugged. ‘What of it? Only words, Ryadd. Only words.’</p>
<p>The Tiste Andii leaned forward then, over the cliff’s edge, and slipped out of sight. A moment later he lifted back into view, a bone-white dragon, white as the snow below, where his winged shadow slipped in pursuit.</p>
<p>Ryadd stood a moment longer, and then turned away from the cave mouth. The fire blazed until the swords started singing in the heat.</p>

<h2 id="the-crippled-god-chapter-16">The Crippled God, Chapter 16</h2>
<p>(饿者注：这段真的是 Silchas&amp;Tulas (Silchas 你反思一下为什么你和谁放在一起都显得基基的)，但认真嗑的话用它嗑 Anomander&amp;Silchas 也未尝不可)</p>
<p>‘Tulas.’</p>
<p>‘Yes?’</p>
<p>‘He saw my grief. He joined with me in my search.’</p>
<p>Tulas Shorn looked away, said nothing.</p>
<p>‘Tulas, Anomander—’</p>
<p>‘No, friend. Not yet – I – I am not yet ready to think of him. I am sorry.’</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin’s breath was ragged. He lifted a hand to his face, looked away, and then nodded. ‘As you wish.’ He laughed harshly. ‘It matters not, anyway. Not any more. He is dead.’</p>
<p>‘I know that,’ Tulas said, reaching out to grasp Silchas’s right shoulder. ‘And more than ever, it matters. If we do not speak of your loss – for a time – it does not mean I feel nothing of your grief. Understand me, please.’</p>
<p>‘Very well.’</p>
<p>Tulas eyed the Tiste Andii. ‘Curse of the Eleint,’ he said.</p>
<p>But his friend flinched. Neither spoke for a time. The Hust sword at Silchas’s belt was muttering in its scabbard. Then Silchas looked up. ‘Oh, there is one other thing – a spawn of Menandore—’</p>
<p>‘An enemy?’</p>
<p>‘He was born this side of Starvald Demelain.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, then a potential ally. Three…a good number. Does this child command the power inside him, does he rule the rage within?’</p>
<p>‘If he did, he would be here with us now.’</p>
<p>‘I see. Then what shall be his fate?’</p>
<p>‘I have not yet decided.’</p>
<p>They began walking north. The tundra stretched out on all sides. Small birds flitted among the low growth, and spinning clouds of midges lifted from the path they took. In the vast distance stretched a gleaming white line, marking the edge of the ice fields.</p>
<p>‘I sense the hand of Elder Gods in all this,’ Tulas Shorn said after a time.</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘What do they want?’</p>
<p>‘What they always want. A return to power.’</p>
<p>‘In the time of my deathlessness, Silchas, I came to understand the truth of that old saying: you cannot go back.’</p>
<p>‘They know it, but it won’t stop them from trying. And in trying, they may well destroy this world and countless others. They may well kill K’rul himself.’</p>
<p>‘A bold gamble, then.’</p>
<p>Silchas nodded. ‘The boldest.’</p>
<p>‘Sechul Lath, then?’</p>
<p>‘And Errastas, yes.’</p>
<p>‘So, Sechul Lath casts the die, and Errastas nudges the last tip – the game is rigged, friend.’</p>
<p>‘Just the way they like it, yes.’</p>
<p>‘Will you still play?’</p>
<p>Silchas looked thoughtful, and then he sighed. ‘They consider themselves masters at cheating. But then, I think this will be the first time that they sit at a table with mortal humans facing them. Cheating? When it comes to that, the Elder Gods are as children compared to humans. Since the time of my return, this much at least I have learned.’</p>
<p>‘The game is in danger of being turned?’</p>
<p>Silchas glanced across at him, and grinned. ‘I think…yes: just watch, Tulas. Just watch.’</p>
<p>In the scabbard, the sword gurgled. Laughter or, Tulas mused, choking.</p>
<p>‘My friend, how did you come by that weapon?’</p>
<p>‘A gift.’</p>
<p>‘From whom? Are they mad?’</p>
<p>‘Shadow.’</p>
<p>Tulas found he had nothing to say. <em>Struck speechless</em>, as the fire tellers used to say. Grimacing, he struggled, desperate to voice a warning – anything.</p>
<p>Silchas glanced over. ‘Not Edgewalker, Tulas.’</p>
<p><em>Edge— No, it cannot be – he could not have – oh, wonders of the Abyss!</em> His voice cracked when at last he managed to speak. ‘I forgive him.’</p>
<p>Silchas frowned across at him. ‘Who?’</p>
<p>‘Your brother,’ Tulas replied in a broken rasp. ‘I forgive him – for all of it – for my anger, now proved so…so misplaced. Gods below, Silchas! He spoke true! But – how? <em>How did he manage it?</em>’</p>
<p>Silchas was still frowning. ‘I don’t understand, Tulas. How did he manage what?’</p>
<p>Tulas stared at Silchas Ruin. A moment’s disbelief, but then he shook his head. <em>He said nothing, then, not even to his beloved brother. He was true to his word. He held the secret close and not once yielded a single word, not a single hint – else it would be known by now. It would be known!</em></p>
<p>‘Tulas?’</p>
<p>‘I forgive him, Silchas.’</p>
<p>‘I – I am so pleased. I am…humbled, friend. You see, that day, I remain convinced that it was not as it seemed—’</p>
<p>‘Oh, indeed, it was not.’</p>
<p>‘Can you explain, then?’</p>
<p>‘No.’</p>
<p>‘Tulas?’</p>
<p>They had halted. The sun was low on the horizon, painting the northern ice lurid shades of crimson. The midges whined in agitated clouds.</p>
<p>Tulas sighed. ‘To tell you, my friend, would be to betray his last secret. I forgive him, yes, but I already fear that he would not forgive me, if he could. For my words. My rage. My stupidity. If I now yield his last secret, all hope for me is lost. I beg you to understand.’</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin’s smile was tight. ‘My brother had a secret he kept even from me?’</p>
<p>‘From everyone.’</p>
<p>‘Everyone but you.’</p>
<p>‘It was to me that he vowed to say nothing, ever.’</p>
<p>The Tiste Andii’s eyes narrowed. ‘A secret as dangerous as that?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>Silchas grunted, but it was a despairing sound. ‘Oh, my friend. Does it not occur to you that, with a secret as deadly as you seem to suggest, my brother would do all he needed to to prevent its revelation?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, that has occurred to me.’</p>
<p>‘Including killing you.’</p>
<p>Tulas nodded. ‘Yes. You may have explained my demise. Your brother murdered me.’ <em>And to complete the deception, he helped his brother look for me.</em></p>
<p>‘But—’</p>
<p>‘Still, Silchas, I forgive him. Between your brother and me, after all, I had clearly announced myself the unreliable one. I know it is difficult for you to accept that he would keep this from you—’</p>
<p>Silchas barked a laugh. ‘Dawn’s fire, Tulas, you are out of practice. I was being ironic. My brother kept things from me? Hardly a revelation to crush me underfoot. Anomander had many lessons to give me about pride, and, finally, a few of them have stuck.’</p>
<p>‘The world is vast yet—’</p>
<p>‘—truths are rare. Just so.’</p>

<h2 id="the-crippled-god-chapter-22">The Crippled God, Chapter 22</h2>
<p>(饿者注：我很喜欢这一段，但如果你觉得它不适合用来嗑 AS 那我也是同意的)</p>
<p><em>My brother could not have planned for this. To see so much of his work…unravelled. He understood the necessity of balance, but he also understood the wonder that is life itself. No, he could not have meant this to happen.</em> Silchas Ruin glanced over to where Tulas Shorn stood on the bluff’s edge. Escape from death is never the escape you think it is. ‘Would we have done it?’ he called over.</p>
<p>The undead warrior’s head turned, tilted slightly. ‘We were young. Anything was possible.’</p>
<p>‘Then…one of us would have knelt before the body of the other, weeping.’</p>
<p>‘That is likely.’</p>
<p>‘But now…Tulas, it seems we shall fight side by side, and there will be none to kneel by our bodies, none to weep for us.’</p>
<p>‘My Hounds are wandering – I can feel them. Hunting interlopers, dreaming of the chase. They wander the broken fragments of Kurald Emurlahn.’</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin was silent, wondering where his friend’s thoughts were taking him.</p>
<p>Tulas Shorn sighed, the breath a long, dry rattle. ‘Do you know what I envy most about my Hounds? Their freedom. Nothing complicated in their lives. No…difficult choices.’</p>
<p>Nodding, Silchas looked away. ‘We face one now, don’t we?’</p>
<p>‘The Eleint will be driven to frenzy. Their entire being will be consumed with the need to kill Korabas – can you not feel it in your own blood, Silchas?’</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>Tulas continued, ‘We are left to a matter of faith. I doubt even Anomander could have anticipated that the Elder Gods would be so desperate, so vengeful.’</p>
<p>‘And this is what is troubling me,’ Silchas Ruin admitted. ‘We cannot assume that all the Elder Gods acceded to the unchaining of the Otataral Dragon.’</p>
<p>‘Does it matter?’</p>
<p>‘I’m not sure.’</p>
<p>Tulas Shorn walked back from the edge. ‘Will any of them regret the annihilation of the gods? I doubt it. Once their children are gone, their resurrection is assured.’</p>
<p>‘To inherit what, Tulas?’</p>
<p>‘Ah, yes, but they do expect the Eleint to kill Korabas. They require it, in fact.’</p>
<p>‘Must we satisfy them?’ Silchas asked.</p>
<p>Tulas Shorn was for a while silent, and his face taken into death could give no expression, and the eyes were closed doors. ‘My friend, what choice have we? If Korabas survives, this realm will die, and it will be the first of many.’</p>
<p>‘Leaving in its wake a land without magic. But even in such places life will return.’</p>
<p>‘We cannot be certain of that. For all that we have explored the secrets of sorcery, we still know so little. We have flown over lifeless flesh – we have seen what happens when everything is truly stripped away.’</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin studied his friend for a moment, then lowered himself into a squat and stared out over the valley to the south. ‘Am I fooling myself?’</p>
<p>‘About what?’</p>
<p>Silchas started, unaware that he had spoken out loud. ‘My brother knew well the Elder Gods. He’d clashed with them often enough.’</p>
<p>‘It may be that his answer to the threat posed by the Elder Gods was to free Draconus.’</p>
<p><em>Draconus.</em> ‘Then what will Draconus do?’</p>
<p>‘I do not know, but even thinking about it fills me with fear. We know well what comes when Draconus is awakened to true anger – his solution may prove worse than the problem. Abyss knows, friend, we have seen that for ourselves. Still, since you have asked, I will give the matter some thought. Draconus…freed. Who can oppose him, now that your brother is dead? I don’t know – this world has moved on. What would he do first? He would hunt down and kill the ones who freed Korabas. He always took retribution seriously.’</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin was nodding. ‘And then?’</p>
<p>The undead warrior shrugged. ‘Kill Korabas?’</p>
<p>‘Leaving a realm filled with Eleint?’</p>
<p>‘Then…perhaps he would stand back and watch the two elemental forces collide and maul each other, until one emerged victorious – but so weakened, so destroyed, that he need only act expeditiously, without rage. It may be that this is what your brother demanded of Draconus, in exchange for his freedom.’</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin held his hands up to his face. After a moment he shook his head. ‘Knowing my brother, there was no demand. There was only giving.’</p>
<p>‘Friend,’ said Tulas Shorn, ‘what is it that is in your mind?’</p>
<p>‘That there is more to the unchaining of Korabas than we know. That, in some manner we have yet to fathom, the Otataral Dragon’s freedom serves a higher purpose. Korabas is here because she needs to be.’</p>
<p>‘Silchas – your living senses are sharper than my dead ones. How many Eleint have come into this world?’</p>
<p>The white-skinned Tiste Andii lowered his hands from his face and looked over at Tulas Shorn. ‘All of them.’</p>
<p>Tulas Shorn staggered back a step, and then turned away – almost as if his every instinct was demanding that he flee, that he get away. <em>Where? Anywhere.</em> And then he faced Silchas again. ‘Korabas does not stand a chance.’</p>
<p>‘No, she does not.’</p>
<p>‘The Eleint will conquer this world – who is there to stop them? My friend – we have been made irrelevant. All purpose…gone. I will not surrender to T’iam!’</p>
<p>The sudden anger in Tulas made Silchas straighten. ‘Nor will I.’</p>
<p>‘What can we do?’</p>
<p>‘We can hope.’</p>
<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>
<p>‘You say you sense the Hounds of Shadow—’</p>
<p>‘Not close—’</p>
<p>‘And you tell me that they possess a new master, the usurper of Kurald Emurlahn—’</p>
<p>‘Who commands nothing.’</p>
<p>‘No. Not yet. There is a game being played here – beyond all that we think we understand of this situation. You say the Hounds are wandering. The question that needs to be asked is: why? What has Shadow to do with any of this?’</p>
<p>Tulas Shorn shook his head.</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin drew out his Hust sword. ‘That usurper gave this weapon to me, as I told you. See the blade? Watermarked and etched with dragons. But there is more – there is my brother’s sacrifice. There is the return of Mother Dark.’</p>
<p>‘And now Draconus. Silchas – your brother, he cannot have meant to—’</p>
<p>‘But I think he did, Tulas. We children were as responsible for what happened between Mother Dark and her consort as anyone was – even Osserc. My friend – they set something into play. Anomander, this Shadowthrone, even Hood, and perhaps many other gods hidden from our view, for ever veiled.’</p>
<p>‘Draconus will never return to Mother Dark – do you truly believe those wounds could ever heal?’</p>
<p>‘Tulas, the Eleint must be faced down – they must be driven back. They are the Children of Chaos, and who has always stood against Chaos? What was Dragnipur, Tulas, if not a broken man’s attempt to save the woman he had lost? It failed – Abyss knows how it failed – but now, at last, Draconus has been freed – his own chains for ever cut away from him. Don’t you see? My brother ended Mother Dark’s vow of isolation – once again she faces her children. But why should it stop there? Tulas! My brother also freed Draconus.’</p>
<p>‘Anomander would force the wounds to heal? The arrogance of the man!’</p>
<p>‘He forces nothing, Tulas. He but opens the door. He makes possible…<em>anything.</em>’</p>
<p>‘Does Draconus understand?’</p>
<p><em>Now that is the question, isn’t it?</em> ‘When he is done killing the Elder Gods he feels should be killed, he will pause. He will ask himself the question, <em>what now?</em> And then, perhaps, it will come to him. The fullest recognition of Anomander’s gift.’</p>
<p>‘My friend, if I truly had breath, you would have taken it from me. But…how can you be certain? Of any of this?’</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin studied the sword in his hand. ‘I think I know who crouches at the centre of this mad web. Tulas, when I veer, what happens to this Hust sword?’</p>
<p>‘It becomes one with the fibre of your flesh and bone – as you well know, Silchas.’</p>
<p>‘Yes…but this is a <em>Hust</em> – a slayer of dragons.’</p>
<p>‘Was the usurper trying to tell you something, do you think?’</p>
<p>‘I begin to suspect the gift wasn’t the sword. The gift was what the sword meant – what it means.’ He sheathed the weapon. ‘The time has come, friend, for our last stand. War we shall now wage.’</p>
<p>Another rattle from Tulas Shorn’s dry throat, but this time it was laughter. ‘I delight in this irony, beloved blade-brother. Very well, let us go and kill some dragons.’ Then he paused and cocked his head at Silchas. ‘Korabas…will she thank us?’</p>
<p>‘Do you expect her to?’</p>
<p>‘No, I suppose not. Why should she? We will fail.’</p>
<p>‘Now,’ Silchas mused, ‘you give me reason to wonder. After all, will this not be the first time that she does not fall alone?’</p>
<p>Tulas was silent for a moment, and then he said, ‘My friend, our deaths shall be our gift to her.’</p>
<p>‘Tulas, can two Ancients make a Storm?’</p>
<p>‘We shall have to try.’</p>
<p><em>Anomander, I believe I shall see you soon. And Andarist, too.</em></p>
<p>‘Since we are about to die, Silchas, will you tell me what happened to the Throne of Shadow?’</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin smiled and shook his head. ‘Perhaps, if the throne so desires, it will one day tell you itself.’</p>
<p>‘Thrones cannot speak.’</p>
<p>‘That is true, and it’s just as well, don’t you think?’</p>
<p>‘It is a good thing we are going to die side by side,’ Tulas Shorn growled, ‘else I would be forced to fight you after all.’</p>
<p>They had moved well apart, and now they veered.</p>
<p>And two Ancient dragons, one living, the other undead, lifted into the empty sky.</p>
