<p>推荐 BGM：Glass Animals 任意一首（听着写的，不听也行）</p>
<p>DeepL + 手校弄了个英文，大概有这样那样的问题，在后面存了一下</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-wasteland">1. Wasteland</h2>
<p>你来了？我没指望在这里看到你，不过对你这个年纪的人，出来散散心也是件好事。你的父亲和 Imass 可安好？希望你没和 Kilava 发生什么不快的事。你庆祝了 Olar Ethil 的死吗？好，好，我向你道歉，我错看了你，你毕竟还是学会了一些东西。</p>
<p>你问我这剑鞘为什么是空的？啊 Ryadd Eleis，我发了一个誓。</p>
<p>……Shadowthrone 把困难的部分完成了，现在要释放它们，我只需要毁掉那把剑。别惊讶，有时做点牺牲是必要的事。我去了 Darujhistan，在 K&rsquo;rul 的圣坛那里找到了 High Mason。他背着锤子，找了个最宽大的凳子喝闷酒，我坐到他对面，和他说这酒我请了。他阴郁着问我有什么事，我告诉他我要砸碎这把剑。</p>
<p>“滚，”他说。</p>
<p>我们喝了很多，我一边解释，一边恳求。我说了龙的来历，我的誓言，回答了他所有的问题，从我为什么又回到了这个世界到 Nimander 最近怎么样了，反复地做出各种各样的保证，天快亮了，Caladan 告诉了我一个奇怪的事实：Gadrobi 山中有一座坟墓。他要求我陪他去那座墓一次，然后找个荒僻的地方砸碎我的剑，因为他不想扰死者的安眠。</p>
<p>“之后我们两不相欠。”他仍然阴沉着脸说，“我希望我们再也不要再见了。”</p>
<p>他说这话的时候，我知道太阳升起来了。</p>
<p>之后的事？之后就像我们约定的那样。那座墓并不豪华，也不显眼，Caladan 尊重了我哥哥的意愿……同时也尊重了他自己的。我们清扫了落叶，在墓前放上些石子——黑暗是我的家啊，我能感觉到石头另一侧躺着的那些骨骸。你不是 Tiste Andii，我们的行为大概会让你觉得怪异，我们对死者不管不问，是因为相信他们一旦离开，我们的爱就没有意义——也就不该存在——也就不再存在。但当我站在那里，感觉到青苔是如何爬上他的眉毛，我知道我仍然爱他，以一种新的，充满哀愁的方式。</p>
<hr>
<p>我以为你昨天夜里就该走了，我今天要做的事不是属于你这个年纪的人的——不，别以为我有意疏远你，你可以留下。留下吧。</p>
<p>我回到 Wasteland 是因为发现葬礼并不是全无意义的事。</p>
<p>我的一个朋友在这里死了。不是……不是那种死亡；你知道我们常常有两次机会，第二次机会是做不死人或鬼魂或神，在那之后就什么都没有了。还好没有过太多年，我在沙子里淘到一些可疑的碎片——这一捧。没错，摸着像化石。你比我年轻，Ryadd Eleis……你能在这里面感觉到 Kurald Emurlahn 吗？</p>
<p>或许这样也很好；墓是修给生者的。</p>
<p>Tulas 是为我死的，救了我最后一次，现在如果我偶尔睡着，还会做关于他的梦。棕色的龙俯冲下来，我知道它是冲我来的，但一切都太迟了。但他扑了上去，他们碰撞得如此猛烈，血肉和骨头——不，不，别说如果你在那里会如何，我离开前讲给你的话句句是真的，也别以为我会想修你的坟墓！</p>
<p>……我和你讲过吗？他在 Kharkanas 的时候，深夜，很落寞地，穿着不合身的皱皱巴巴的礼服，在路边看到一只流浪的野狗，竟从口袋里掏出香肠来喂它？</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-letheras">2. Letheras</h2>
<p>我以为你会想在 Letheras 再多暂住几天，传说这里如今不是像以前那么残酷的地方了。此外我尝过 Tehol 王的舰队带来的酒，味道奇特，但并不算难以入口。你试过当地的食物吗？Brys Beddict 向我保证过，如果我找个好厨师合伙，不出五年就会发财的；但我觉得这想法太可怕，所以回绝了。</p>
<p>这一次我……不知道我要去哪里。我是真心的。</p>
<p>Caladan Brood 领我到一个无人的山谷，令土里长出两块石头，石上有凹槽，刚好可以把剑放在里面。过了一会他看着我，又过了一会他比了个“请”的手势，很不耐烦，像在催促。我这才发现右手锁在了剑柄上，指节的皮肤拉扯得疼；剑从剑鞘滑出一半，焊死在了半空中。他问我：“你到了最后却要反悔吗？”</p>
<p>那魔咒却已除去，剑已躺在行刑台上，大声惨叫。Caladan 的锤子落下，它的最后一声尖叫逼我捂住耳朵；我们周围的土地爆开，飞出三条龙来，铁链的碎片像雨一样落到地上。</p>
<p>不，我回答他，只是现在我不知道该做什么了。</p>
<p>……是，我后来还是想出了些事去做，在 Gredfallan 上花掉一半盘缠之后。别问坟墓上 Kurald Galain 的魔法是怎么编织的了。你既不缺力量，也不缺技巧，我祝你也不要有这需要；但现在葬礼已完成了。</p>
<p>是，那么就这样吧，你和我，我们先留在这里。一个篝火边的夜晚。</p>
<hr>
<p>你知道 Killanthir 吗？我没和你讲过他，他在历史上不是一个很重要的人。这里，在这附近他第一次死去了。他第二次也是真正的死亡是 Refugium 门口。Moon&rsquo;s Spawn 重现世间的那天，我们不在那里；这是好的，八个 Moon&rsquo;s Spawn 足够伤到我们。我说这话是为了告诉你它们在 K&rsquo;Chain 手中有多致命。</p>
<p>我要他拖住那些遮天蔽日的建筑，给我和我的盟友争取时间。两条龙——那时我们只有两条龙。如果有十条，结果大概会不一样吧。</p>
<p>“Lord，”他问我，“我有多少人？”</p>
<p>除了少量随队法师用以辅助对抗 K&rsquo;ell Hunter 的进攻之外，我全都给他了。他说这会让我们面对 K&rsquo;ell 时过于脆弱，造成不必要的死亡。我告诉他我要把几乎所有法师都安排给他。于是他知道——我也清楚他知道——他们要死了。</p>
<p>“您需要多少时间？”他问我。“越久越好。”我告诉他，“直到你看见最后一个天空城坠落，或你们最后一个人倒下。”他什么都没有说，行了一个礼就走了。</p>
<p>……没有这种可能。连我都不知道过了多少年，骨头和牙齿在这么久的时间面前也会成为灰。Azath 到底有什么魔法，Ryadd Eleis？在他们形影消灭这么多年后，为什么我还会行走于这世间？</p>
<h2 id="3-seashore">3. Seashore</h2>
<p>好啦，Ryadd，松开我的手。我知道你觉得它很有趣，你不是第一个这样想的孩子。好，好，你已经长大了。你问在你之前还有谁？——Kettle，我们先不谈她了吧。另一个是 Sandalath Drukorlat，她是在我的家族中长大的。你能想象吗？我年轻的时候也住过华贵的房子，甚至不是要塞，有长长的走廊与雕花的窗户，还有挂满织锦的房间！我曾经牵着她走过所有这些地方。晚上我有时给她讲睡前故事，她固执地要我只在床头柜上留一盏油灯，说我的红眼睛就是两盏蜡烛……我讲过龙的混战和 Tarns 的起源传说。在见了血的片段里，墙上巨大的影子把她吓得一惊一乍。我时常想，这样性格温和的人怎能忍受做女王呢？</p>
<p>我听说她回家后的际遇十分悲惨，虽然我的了解不一定准确：先是失去父亲，又怀了一个酒鬼的孩子，再然后被母亲第二次送去做人质。不知道遭受了什么折磨，总之一夜间她生下了第二个孩子，一个女儿，那时有传言说她疯了。后来我逃离了 Kurald Galain，在路上遇到 Sandalath，她身后跟着一群难民，因为她虽然年轻但毕竟是个贵族。大混乱的时候，人大约是要抓住一点熟悉的东西。我记不太清那天发生什么了，我那时受了很重的伤。但我记得她的额头和眼睛：我一看就知道传言多半是真的，同时我知道她至少那时没有疯。</p>
<p>我向他们承诺过，我会把他们带到一个新世界。这我做到了。但这个世界那时满是 K&rsquo;Chain，他们那时还没有现在这样智慧，我们也没有——到处是战火，我并没有把他们带到一个和平的世界。Tiste Andii 是在内战中磨练出的战士，但我们还是有自己的极限。不可能带着难民穿越大半个战争中的大陆。</p>
<p>我现在记起来了，为什么我要和你走这条路，为什么会谈起这个人。和我一起站起来——在那里，看到了吗，海边那片平原？我曾经安排过一支庞大的军队在那里，只在队伍里插了少量的老兵，大部分都是仓促训练过的平民。这只可怜的军队正面迎战了 K&rsquo;Chain，慢慢死去，慢慢被赶进海里，他们用自己的血困住了 K&rsquo;Chain。敌人忙着屠杀，我趁其不备，攻打了他们的侧翼。那天 K&rsquo;Chain 和 Tiste 平民的血染红了半个 Bluerose 海湾。</p>
<p>我命令不知情的平民去死，Ryadd Eleis。我知道 Sandalath Drukorlat 在那支队伍中，她曾经多么喜欢玩弄我这双杀人的手。直到夕阳西下、一天的战事结束，我才想起她来。我知道她已经死了。</p>
<h2 id="4-andara">4. Andara</h2>
<p>我以为你该离开的。我以为你会恨我的。别争论！事情本该如此，如果你们按我所配得的那样恨我，就像 Anomander 的子民一样，我恐怕反而会自在得多。</p>
<p>……不，如今这样也很好。留下吧。我现在知道未竟之事是什么了，或许我一直都知道？只是不愿去想。你知道我最后的那场绝望的远征，在这片大陆上留下了许多亡灵。有许多被奴役，更多的在这些年里破碎了，Killanthir 初次死去的地方，空气里尚且弥漫着灵魂的碎片。但那些幸存的灵魂曾躲避在 Andara，活着的 Tiste Andii 曾经躲藏的地方，直到活人同样为我的缘故而死。那就是我要去的地方，这一次轮到我来流血。</p>
<p>我为什么犹豫？因为他们不肯恨我。有许多死者甚至还忠于我，还爱着我。我方才说过，有时爱比恨更难忍受；我怎敢到他们中间？但这事不看我的意思，我总得有一次做正确的事。</p>
<p>我要起飞了，Ryadd Eleis，我不会向你隐瞒方位。我只求你在这里等我十二个时辰，然后再追来；或者如果你回心转意，就告诉我你已走了。</p>
<p>我说这话不是为了你，虽然你确实不该碰触他们的悲伤。但我更多是为了那些流亡的灵魂——你太明亮，Ryadd Eleis，我怕他们承受不了你的欢乐。</p>
<h2 id="5-gallans-road">5. Gallan&rsquo;s Road</h2>
<p>你果然跟来了，你不愿放我独自受苦吗？</p>
<p>不要怕，鬼魂在这里比在生者的世界强壮得多。</p>
<p>很奇怪，这是一条迂回的路。Gallan 修建这条通道时，大概发自内心地不想让我们抵达终点。我刚来到流亡者中间时，看见一个木匠在打他的儿子，那儿子十几岁大，身材瘦弱，怀里紧紧地抱着一本书。我喝止了木匠，带走了孩子，让人补偿了那父亲一些物资。我带走他是因为那男孩离开这条路时将成长为一个脾气古怪的青年，一个高阶法师，他的名字将是 Killanthir。</p>
<p>我曾在这里听 Sandalath Drukorlat 向我汇报营地里的强奸事件。我把他们斩首示众。</p>
<p>我在这条路边拥抱了 Scara Bandaris，我们在他华贵的帐篷里略微叙了旧。他谈到 Jheleck 的土地，说一个人骑马跨越它们是多么寂寞。那时他还在说，很高兴如今我们又在彼此身边。</p>
<p>我曾在这里，站在队伍的前头，一步步地往前走着。我身后是我决意牺牲的人——我这样走着，两次！第一次我同你讲过，第二次是 Kettle。我庆幸我教你走在我旁边。</p>
<p>别这样说！别以为你完全了解我，别以为我爱你！</p>
<h2 id="6-sedis">6. Sedis</h2>
<p>先别急着寻找 Kharkanas，我亲爱的朋友，别忘了 Kurald Galain 是个很大的地方。也别问我亡魂去了哪里，他们自会找他们喜欢的地方。现在我们又是孤身一人了——哈哈。</p>
<p>我们现在走的地方多年前是 Tiste 和 Jheleck 领地的交界。远处那废墟是 Sedis Keep，Scara Bandaris 曾经在那里驻守过一段时间，看守我们如今走的这条路。我们走过去吧，时候还早，我猜你想过个头顶有屋檐的晚上。别怕，它剩下的部分一时半会还塌不了。</p>
<p>你问我在这里怎么判断时候？假如你是 Tiste Andii，你自会知道的。</p>
<p>我们和 Jheleck 开战的前夜，在这里——大约是这里——点燃了一堆火。Scara 斟满一杯麦酒，甚至洒了出来，他在火堆前站直，火光把他涂成一个巨人。“战争——是狗屎！”他喊。我们都笑了起来啊，从最新入伍的士兵到军官，那些急着一次次检查兵器的手也放松下来。你可知道这是多宝贵的一份礼物；过于紧张、笃定自己会死的士兵，说不定真的会死的。第二天我们大胜。</p>
<p>后来我和他一起巡逻过几次。你有酒吗，Ryadd Eleis？哈，不用回答我，我知道你没有，我也一样。我是说如果不围在哪里喝酒，我是给你形容不好那些晚上多么有趣的。该死的贵族生活！如果我是个平民，没有那样的父亲和那样的兄长，我就去投奔他，给他做个杂兵的日子可比在朝堂上有生气得多。</p>
<p>你说后来的事你想不通？我也想不通，他原来真是很好的一个朋友。我不是说他把我扔进 Azath 那件事，那是完全合情理的。但在那之前，在我们岌岌可危的联盟之前，他先是奸杀了 Andarist 的未婚妻，让我哥哥悲伤得发了疯，又像个信使一样从 Neret Sorr 赶来，指望我会听他的话。光是我们的 Hust 就死了三千男女，而他指望我听他的话！被拒绝之后，他说，他自己向北骑到了这些荒地上。唉，我突然想问问他，可惜他已经死了——那时他孤身一人来到这里是什么感觉。</p>
<h2 id="7-andarist">7. Andarist</h2>
<p>我哥哥 Andarist 是个非常不会说谎的人，和我可不一样。所以他恋爱的时候，Anomander 和我几乎立刻就发现了：第一个迹象是出席舞会前，他多花了一刻钟时间摆弄领子，我一问他他就笑了。</p>
<p>“你是爱上了谁啊？”我问他。他笑着不答话。我说：“别告诉我是 Spinnock，我可想不到。”Andarist 连忙颇严肃地摇头道：“还说不上爱。我不过是非常非常喜欢她罢了。”</p>
<p>他没有不带随从远游的习惯，他的行程瞒不过我们。很快我就知道了他爱上的是 Jaen Enes 的女儿。他们在荒野上漫无边际地骑马，在 Dorssan Ryl 河边捧着书坐一个下午，他在舞会上邀请她的那副模样，青涩得像个不会跳舞的人似的，小心得像捧着水晶。我曾经开玩笑地问他有没有和她上过床。Andarist 说还没有，因为他感到他们还不够爱彼此，如果贸然更进一步，双方都会受伤的。</p>
<p>我那时大为讶异。爱的一大杀手是死，这是我们的家族反复证明过的。杀过人的人心里有一扇门是永远关上的，不然我们就要取了自己的性命。Anomander 年轻的时候，疯狂地爱过 Hish Tulla。我知道，他甚至不能忍受和她迟一点见面，便让 Gripp Galas 替他放哨，躲着父亲……而我在隔壁的房间里偷听，压低了声音笑。你知道那段感情是怎么结束的吗？男人们去打了 Jhelarkan War。回来后不久，我看见大哥深夜坐在大厅里，只有他一个人，一支蜡烛，一瓶酒。我在他旁边坐下，问他是出了什么事，他说 Hish 和他分开了。</p>
<p>我安慰他别伤心，她若是不长情的女人，她的爱也没有那么大的价值。他直直地盯着我，然后摇头道：“不是那回事，Silchas，你不懂。不是她辜负了我，而是我辜负了她。我再不能像以前那样爱了。”</p>
<p>多年以后，我像是不信邪一样接近了 Hish Tulla。我发现我哥哥好像说得对。我们在一起的时候快乐过，但结婚？想都不要想。我们没必要为政治的理由结合，更不是为了爱情，我们想象不了一个有对方的未来。我那时真的能想象未来吗？她在我面前又犀利又风趣，我对她也体贴，我们一起去这里、出席那个——但有很多东西我们是默契地不能谈的。很快我就像 Anomander 一样自己找个地方喝酒了。</p>
<p>现在你该知道 Andarist 是个怎样的神迹。他爱 Enesdia，甚至可能比她爱他还要深，谁说得准呢？我从来看不懂这类事情。一个晴天，我的二哥收拾衣装，驾车前往 Jaen Enes 的家；Anomander 心领神会，很快向 Enesdia 发出了请帖。那天我仔细端详她，看她拉着侍女的手，小心翼翼下了马车。他们订婚了。Anomander 在礼节之事上代行了父亲的职责，此外又从私人的资产中出了一笔钱，要替 Andarist 在两家之间修一座新居，以示永恒的友谊与祝福。Andarist 反对过，说这笔钱应该由他自己出，Anomander 按着他的肩膀，想都不要想，这是他送给他亲爱的兄弟的礼物。他不仅要修，还要修得很美，要请 Azathanai 祝福这房子，请最好的石匠替它立下写着祷文的炉底石。</p>
<p>我后来细细地端详了 Enesdia——我有些失望——我觉得她的性格里有些缺点，她不是我完美的哥哥该有的完美的女人，而且她爱他不如他爱她那么深。我曾经想过——天知道我曾经想过什么！后来的事情你都知道了。内战的历史，我在 Wasteland 和你说过的，唯独这段我想你很难忘记。</p>
<p>看现在踏在我们脚下的这块石头吧。它经历了如此漫长的时光，竟然看上去还是全新的。它是 Caladan Brood 的礼物，上面沾了 Anomander 的血。那边的门槛是 Tiste 手笔，没这么好运——在那门槛下埋着我哥哥的未婚妻。</p>
<h2 id="8-purake">8. Purake</h2>
<p>这是很多年以前我住过的地方。真奇怪，房屋竟然没怎么垮塌，我听说 K&rsquo;rul 祝福过这里，现在看来或许是真的。这里住过很多让人印象深刻的人，Sandalath，Andarist，他们的故事我已经和你讲过。我讲不了 Anomander——创痛甚巨，还不到梳理与讲述的时候。我该和你回忆谁呢？我童年的神明 Gripp Galas，剑术课上永远那么高大的老师，我在十三岁的时候第一次打败了他？Prazek 和 Dathenar，我还是个孩子的时候他们不知跑到那里去了，我跟着 Kellaras 去找他们，结果被他们三个在桥底下的酒吧里拖进了饮酒的恶习？</p>
<p>你竟然想听我的父母。好吧，我先从父亲讲起……我竟不太记得他在这间房子里的样子了。我记得他很高，但实际上或许比我——或你——还矮些。但更壮实。他大多数时候是严肃的，但也不缺少慈爱，具体的事情若我想起来了，就在去 Kharkanas 的路上给你讲。真正深刻的印象要轮到 Forulkan War，仅有贵族参战时，战况非常艰难，我和父亲不敌，在一条山路上撤退。</p>
<p>Anomander 当时和 Andarist 一起，分兵去了别的地方，只有我和 Nimander Purake，必须留下一个人断后，另一个人才可能活。我越过战场的喧闹喊他，让我留下吧。那样你会死的，他哭着吼道。我知道那时的情形，我们的旧王已经死了，没有留下子嗣，战争结束后恐怕要发生政变。我说，我是可牺牲的，但 Kharkanas 不能没有你。</p>
<p>我们守在山路的入口，没想幸存下来，只想着怎么死得最慢。撤退是上午开始的，中午时我还剩下五十个人，太阳偏西时还剩下十二个。然后他们一个个被砍倒了，黄昏时只剩下我一个人；那时我还是凡人一个，一整天的苦战之后，双手已经几乎失去知觉，剑快要变成棍子。那时我突然想起了——很荒唐地，但至今印象很深——多年以前，我和父亲拿着钝剑玩闹似的某一节剑术课。</p>
<p>唉，那时我天真地以为，救他一次就能保住王城的局势。大概想要他死的人很多吧，而且两边都有，但他们很聪明地没有直接杀了他，而是把他弄成了残废。有不少年，父亲无力主事，Anomander 又不敢僭越。后来我对他的印象是一个拄着拐杖的阴郁的人，像幽灵一样在这里游荡。他去世后没几年内战就爆发了，我们三兄弟那时早就知道问题，但早就没有时间了。</p>
<p>但现在让我讲讲母亲吧。我至今不知道她是谁，只知道能排除谁——Mother Dark，十个人里有九个会觉得她是我的生母；但她不是，我们反而是她的保护人。Menandore 不是个好母亲，我理解你不爱她，但这并不意味着我们不需要一个“母亲”的概念。Anomander 似乎记得他的妈妈——一些片段，无论如何，她离开时我们都还很小。我记得他和我详细描述过她的面容和声音，还有她说过的一些话，然而时日久远，我竟然一点也想不起来……如果我能再去问问……</p>
<p>无论如何，看我们现在站的这条走廊。窗户的木制结构已经腐朽干净了，但我可以告诉你，那曾是最好的木头，巧手的工匠雕凿而成……还有这些石阶原本是富有光泽的。我断后的那天发生了不可思议的事情，Kagamandra Tulas 的骑兵突然从敌人后面包抄过来，救了我的命，那是他第一次救我。我在回军营的路上昏了过去，两天后才醒来，做了一个很长的梦。梦里我就站在现在这个地方，我妈妈坐在那里，走廊尽头完好的窗户边，微笑着等我。我像个学步的孩童一样向她蹒跚走去，此生唯一一次看见她的面容。</p>
<h2 id="9-kharkanas">9. Kharkanas</h2>
<p>你说你羡慕我，Ryadd Eleis，对我来说每个地点都是一本翻开的书。哀恸没什么可羡慕的，尽管从外表来看，它可以很美。别羡慕我，不如就在外面看着，别想着钻到我的皮囊里面来；听一听那些已死之人的故事，感受一下地点的纵深，也就够了。</p>
<p>我反而该羡慕你。对你来说没有哪里被如此之多的回忆玷污，你在哪里都可以开始新生活。我是阴暗地嫉妒着你的，我从你身上吸取着力量。我爱听你所有的诘问，所有的不解，那是未受悔恨沾染的常识的力量，为此你不能理解我，但我反而更情愿。</p>
<p>但你虽不能理解我，却一直听着。我为此感激你，并敬佩，并不解。</p>
<hr>
<p>Kharkanas 近了，她在你的脑海里出声了吗？我已经感受到她了。</p>
<p>我去找 Caladan Brood 完成我的誓言之前，叛离了她第二次。我已和你说过她不是我的母亲。她一次次地召唤我，我一次次离开，借口要教 Nimander Golit 治理的艺术，或探望 Sandalath，或监视城内某地的重建之类。终于我不能再逃了，我前往永夜厅。</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin，我仅剩的儿子——她唤我——我拖延太久了。我要祝福你，我要抹去你灵魂上的悲伤。</p>
<p>我反问她，Anomander 为什么要死？</p>
<p>她说，因为他要用二分之一的灵魂撕碎门上的封印，用二分之一的灵魂唤醒无生机的 Kurald Galain，最后一缕游魂用来呼唤她的回归。</p>
<p>我问她，Anomander 为什么必须要死？</p>
<p>她沉默了，然后说出了我想听的那个答案：因为我们做得不够好。</p>
<p>我们做得都不够好，我同意道，所以你没有资格祝福我，我也没有资格诅咒你。</p>
<p>资格是一回事，Mother Dark 没有反对。若是多年前，或许她会愤怒地让我出去。——但我回来了，我有能力祝福你，我看见了你的哀恸，而我可以治愈它——哀恸没什么可羡慕的，也没什么可珍贵的。</p>
<p>但哀恸虽然没什么可羡慕的，于我却是珍贵的。我没法想象——Ryadd Eleis 我无法想象不为 Anomander 哀悼的我，或 Tulas，或我和 Scara 间失去的友情，或不幸的 Andarist，并 Sandalath 和 Killanthir 和许多早已被遗忘的名字和脸庞。唯哀伤痛悔之心让我日日铭记他们，比历史的责任感深刻千百倍。我怎能走出那房间，接受了她的祝福，让那些故事于我从此不过是一段无关的历史，那些地点不过是些新奇的废墟？</p>
<p>您说过——我回答她说，您让我铭记。</p>
<p>我让你铭记，不是让你受苦。她在我背后呼唤道，但我摔门而出。这是我第二次摔门而出，第二次摔门而出的是我。</p>
<p>但这次她没再诅咒我的名字，而我也没下决心再不回来。现在 Kharkanas 已经近在眼前了，我回到了这个我原以为没法忍受的地方。谢天谢地，如今我竟然觉得它是可以忍受的了。或许我不需要再纠结于她的祝福了；或许你已经祝福了我。</p>
<hr>
<p>这已经是 Kharkanas 最明亮的时候了，Ryadd Eleis，之所以明亮完全是因为这些灯。你会习惯的。我的家族在这里有一栋房子，现在出于尊敬，也没人侵占它哪怕一寸。但很遗憾，里面似乎只有一个房间能住人。</p>
<p>我把它留给你吧，我看得出你已经累了。待你休息好了——</p>
<p>……就照你说的办吧。这样也可以。</p>

<h2 id="1-wasteland-1">1. Wasteland</h2>
<p>You have come? I didn&rsquo;t expect to see you here, but it&rsquo;s good for someone your age to get out and about. How fare your father and the Imass? I hope you didn&rsquo;t come to blows or worse with Kilava. Did you celebrate Olar Ethil&rsquo;s death? Well, well, I apologise. I was wrong about you. You have learnt something after all.</p>
<p>You ask me why this scabbard is empty? Ah Ryadd Eleis, I swore an oath.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;Shadowthrone got the hard part done, now to free them I just need to destroy that sword. Don&rsquo;t be surprised, sometimes sacrifice is a necessity. I went to Darujhistan and found the High Mason at the sacred shrine of K&rsquo;rul. He was carrying a hammer and had found the widest stool to drink on. I sat across from him and told him the drink was on me. He asked me sombrely what was the matter, and I told him I would like him to break my sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck off,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>We drank a lot and I pleaded and I explained. I told him about where the dragons had come from, about my vows, and I answered all his questions, from why I was back in this realm to how Nimander had been doing, repeatedly making all sorts of assurances, and as dawn approached, Caladan told me a strange truth: there was a tomb in the Gadrobi mountains. He asked me to accompany him to the tomb once and then to find a deserted, faraway place to do the breaking, because he did not want to disturb the sleep of the dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards neither of us shall be indebted to the other.&rdquo; He said, still grimly, &ldquo;I hope we never see each other again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, I knew the sun was rising.</p>
<p>And after that? After that it was just as we had agreed. The tomb was not luxurious or conspicuous, and Caladan respected my brother&rsquo;s wishes &hellip;&hellip; as he did his own. We cleared the leaves and put polished stones in front of the grave - darkness is home to me, I could feel the bones lying on the other side of the gravestone. You&rsquo;re not Tiste Andii, and our behaviour would probably strike you as odd; we leave the dead alone because we believe that once they&rsquo;re gone, our love will be meaningless - and shouldn&rsquo;t exist - and ceases to exist. But as I stood there, feeling how the moss crawled up his brow, I knew I still loved him, in a new, mournful way.</p>
<hr>
<p>I thought you would have gone last night, that what I was going to do today wasn&rsquo;t for the young - no, don&rsquo;t think I meant to leave you, and you may stay. Stay.</p>
<p>I came back to the Wasteland because I found out that funerals aren&rsquo;t afterall meaningless.</p>
<p>A friend of mine died here. Not &hellip;&hellip; not that kind of death; you know we often get two chances, the second chance as an undead or a spirit or a god, and after that, nothing. Luckily not too many years passed before I plucked these dubious pieces from sand. Yes, it feels like fossil. You&rsquo;re younger than me, Ryadd Eleis &hellip;&hellip; Can you feel Kurald Emurlahn in this?</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s just as well; tombs are built for the living.</p>
<p>Tulas died for me, saved my life one last time, and now if I fall asleep - that said, rarely - I still dream of his death. The brown dragon plummeted down and I knew it was coming for me, but it was too late. But he pounced into it and they collided so violently, flesh and blood and bone - no, no, don&rsquo;t say what would have happened had you been there, every word I told you before I left was true, and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d want to bury you!</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;Had I ever told you? That when he was in Kharkanas, late at night, very forlornly, in his ill-fitting crumpled gown, he saw a stray wild dog by the roadside and fished sausages out of his pocket to feed it?</p>
<h2 id="2-letheras-1">2. Letheras</h2>
<p>I thought you would like to prolong your stay in Letheras, especially when legend has it that it is not as cruel a place as it used to be. Besides, I have tried the wine brought by King Tehol&rsquo;s fleet and it tastes interesting, but not unpalatable. Have you tried the local food? Brys Beddict once promised me that if I found a good cook to partner with I would be rich within five years; but I thought that was horror and turned it down.</p>
<p>This time I &hellip;&hellip; don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going. I mean it.</p>
<p>Caladan Brood led me to a deserted valley and made two pillars of stone grow out of the earth, with grooves in them to slip the sword in. After a while he looked at me, and after a while he made a gesture of &ldquo;please&rdquo;, impatient, urging. Only then did I realise that my right hand was locked to the hilt and the skin of my knuckles stretched painfully; the sword had slipped halfway out of its scabbard and was fixed in mid-air. He asked me, &ldquo;Have you come here only to turn back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This broke the spell of immobility. In a flash the sword was lying on the execution table, screaming loudly; Caladan&rsquo;s hammer fell and its last scream forced my hands to my ears; the earth around us burst open as three dragons sailed up into the air, shards of chain falling to the ground like rain.</p>
<p>No, I answered him, it&rsquo;s just now that I&rsquo;m running out of things to be done.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip; Yes, I did figure out something to do later, after spending half my plate on Gredfallan. Don&rsquo;t ask how the magic of Kurald Galain on the grave was woven. You lack neither strength nor skill, and I wish you never to have that need either; but now the funeral is done.</p>
<p>Aye, then so be it, you and I, we&rsquo;ll stay here for now. A night by the campfire.</p>
<hr>
<p>Do you know Killanthir? I have not told you about him; he is not a very important figure in history. Here, around here he died the first time. His second and true death was at the gate of Refugium. We were not there the day Moon&rsquo;s Spawn returned to this realm; it was well, for eight Moon&rsquo;s Spawn were enough to hurt us grimly. I say this to show you how deadly they are in the hands of the K&rsquo;Chain.</p>
<p>I ordered him to stall the sky-cities to buy time for me and my allies. Two dragons - only two at the time. If there had been ten, it would have played out differently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; he asked me, &ldquo;how many men do I have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gave him all of them, except for a handful of squad mages who would aid the fight against the K&rsquo;ell Hunters. He said it would leave us too vulnerable to K&rsquo;ell and cause unnecessary deaths. I told him I was going to give him almost all the mages. So he knew - and I knew that he knew - that they were all going to die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much time do you need?&rdquo; He asked me. &ldquo;The longer the better.&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;Until you see the last Moon&rsquo;s Spawn fall, or the last of you fall.&rdquo; He said nothing, saluted and left.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip; There is no such possibility. Even I don&rsquo;t know how many years have passed, and bones and teeth become dust long before so much time has passed. How is it that the Azath possesses such sorcery, Ryadd Eleis? Why is it that I still walk this earth whilst they have all died?</p>
<h2 id="3-seashore-1">3. Seashore</h2>
<p>All right, Ryadd, let go of my hand. I know those fingers are interesting, and you&rsquo;re not the first kid to think that. Fine, fine, you&rsquo;re a kid no longer. Who else were there before you, you ask? &ndash;Kettle, but let&rsquo;s not talk about her. The other one was Sandalath Drukorlat, who grew up in my family. Can you imagine it? When I was young I too lived in a grand house, not even a fortress, with long corridors, carved windows and rooms decorated with brocades! I used to walk her through all these places. At night I sometimes told her bedtime stories, and she would stubbornly ask me to light only one oil lamp on the bedside table, for those ruby eyes were as though candles &hellip;&hellip; I told her the legend of warring dragons and the First Tiste in Tarns. The huge shadows flicking on the wall would frighten her when the story grew grim. I often wondered how such a soft girl could bear to be Queen.</p>
<p>I had heard that she returned home to a tragedy, although what I gathered may not be accurate: first she lost her father, then she birthed a drunkard&rsquo;s child, and then she was sent by her mother to be a hostage for a second time. No one knew what she suffered, but in one night she gave birth to a second child, a daughter, and there were rumours then that she had gone mad. Later I escaped from Kurald Galain and met Sandalath on the road, followed by a group of refugees because she was young but a nobleman after all. In times of chaos, one is inclined to cling to any familiarity. I can&rsquo;t quite remember what happened that day, I was badly wounded then. But I remember her forehead and her eyes: I knew at first sight that the rumours were mostly true, while I knew that she was at least not mad then.</p>
<p>I had promised them that I would bring them to a new world. And that I did. But the world was full of K&rsquo;Chain, they weren&rsquo;t as wise then as they are now, and neither were we - there was war everywhere. I didn&rsquo;t bring them to a world of peace. The Tiste Andii army was honed in the civil war, but we still had our limits. It was impossible to escort refugees across half a warring continent.</p>
<p>I remember now why I am walking this path, why I am talking about her. Stand up with me - there, see, that plain by the sea? I had ordered a huge army there, which was composed of hastily trained civilians with no more than a handful of veterans among them. This poor army met the K&rsquo;Chain head on, dying slowly, slowly being driven into the sea. They trapped the K&rsquo;Chain by being slaughtered as I attacked the enemy&rsquo;s flank. The blood of K&rsquo;Chain and Tiste civilians stained half of the Bluerose Bay.</p>
<p>I ordered unwitting civilians to die, Ryadd Eleis. I knew that Sandalath Drukorlat was among them and I remembered how she enjoyed toying with those murderous hands. I didn&rsquo;t think of her until the sun had set and the day&rsquo;s fighting was over. I knew she was dead.</p>
<h2 id="4-andara-1">4. Andara</h2>
<p>I thought you would have left. I thought you would hate me. Don&rsquo;t argue! This is how it should have been. I might have been far more comfortable if you had hated me as I deserved, like Anomander&rsquo;s people did.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip; No, this is just as well. Stay. I now know what my unfinished business is, or perhaps I knew it all along? I just refused to think. You know that my last, desperate expedition left spirits wandering this continent. Many were enslaved, more shattered over the years, and where Killanthir first died, the air is still filled with fragmented souls. But those who survived had taken refuge in Andara, where the living Tiste Andii once hid, until the living also died for my sake. That is where I am going, and this time it is my turn to bleed.</p>
<p>Why do I hesitate? Because they refused to hate me. Many of the dead even had faith in me, they even love me. Sometimes love is harder to bear than hate; how dare I go among them? But it is not up to me, this time I have to do the right thing.</p>
<p>I am taking off, Ryadd Eleis, and I will not conceal my location from you. All I ask is that you wait here for me for twelve bells before you come after me; or better yet, tell me that you have fled.</p>
<p>This is not to protect you, though indeed you should not share their grief. What I ask you is for the wandering spirits - you are too bright, Ryadd Eleis, and I fear they cannot bear your joy.</p>
<h2 id="5-gallans-road-1">5. Gallan&rsquo;s Road</h2>
<p>You have come indeed. Don&rsquo;t you wish to let me suffer alone?</p>
<p>Fear not, the ghosts are much stronger here than in the world of the living.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, it is a tortuous path. When Gallan built it he perhaps didn&rsquo;t intend for us to reach the other side. I had just arrived among the exiles when I saw a carpenter beating his teenage son, who was skinny and clutching a book in his arms. I ordered the carpenter to stop, took the boy away and had the father compensated with supplies. I took him only because the boy would leave this path having grown into an eccentric youth, a High Mage, whose name would be Killanthir.</p>
<p>I was here to hear Sandalath Drukorlat report to me about the rapes in the camp. I beheaded them.</p>
<p>I embraced Scara Bandaris on the side of this road and we talked about our pasts in his splendid tent. He spoke of the lands of Jheleck and how lonely it was to ride across them alone. At the time he was still saying how glad he was that we were now beside each other again.</p>
<p>I was here, standing at the front of the camp, moving forward step by step. Behind me were those I would sacrifice - and I walked this road twice! The first time I had told about you, the second time it was Kettle. I am glad I taught you to walk beside me.</p>
<p>Speak not! Don&rsquo;t you dare think that you know me completely. Don&rsquo;t you dare think I love you!</p>
<h2 id="6-sedis-1">6. Sedis</h2>
<p>Kharkanas is far away yet, my dear friend. Don&rsquo;t forget that Kurald Galain is a large realm. And don&rsquo;t ask me where the spirits have gone, they will find wherever they like. Now we are alone again - ha ha.</p>
<p>These lands were once the border between the territories of Tiste and Jheleck. That ruin in the distance is Sedis Keep, where Scara Bandaris was stationed for a time to watch over the road we&rsquo;re now on. Let&rsquo;s walk over there, it&rsquo;s early yet and I would guess that you would enjoy a night under a solid roof. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, the rest of it won&rsquo;t collapse for a while yet.</p>
<p>How can I tell the time when I&rsquo;m here, you ask? Why, you would know if you were Tiste Andii.</p>
<p>The night before we went to war with the Jheleck, a campfire was lit here - or thereabouts - and Scara filled himself a tankard of ale, so full as to spill, and he stood up straight across from the fire, which painted him a giant. &ldquo;War - it&rsquo;s shit!&rdquo; He shouted. We all laughed, ah, from the greenest recruit to the officers, and those hands that were anxious to check their weapons again and again fell relaxed. Do you know how precious a gift this was? The nervous soldier expecting to die may die. The next day was a great victory.</p>
<p>I had been on patrol with him for a few times since. Have you any wine, Ryadd Eleis? Ha, no need to answer, I know you don&rsquo;t and neither do I. What I mean is that I couldn&rsquo;t fully describe those wondrous nights without us drinking around a campfire. Bloody aristocratic life! If I were a commoner, if I didn&rsquo;t have such a father and such a brother, I&rsquo;d have gone to join him in the ranks and had a much more lively life than that in the courtroom.</p>
<p>You say you don&rsquo;t understand what happened afterwards? Neither do I. He had been a really good friend. I&rsquo;m not talking about him throwing me into the Azath, that made perfect sense. But before that, before our precarious alliance, he raped and killed Andarist&rsquo;s betrothed, driving my brother mad with grief. Then came like a messenger from Neret Sorr, expecting me to listen. Alone in the Hust three thousand men and women had died, and he expected me to listen to him! Having been refused, he said that he rode alone north to these wastelands. Alas, suddenly I want to ask him, though he is dead - I want to ask what it had felt like to come here alone.</p>
<h2 id="7-andarist-1">7. Andarist</h2>
<p>Unlike me, my brother Andarist was a terrible liar. So when he fell in love, Anomander and I noticed it almost immediately: the first sign was him spending half a bell fiddling with his collar before a ball, and he smiled when I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you in love with?&rdquo; I asked him. He smiled but didn&rsquo;t answer. I said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s Spinnock, I can&rsquo;t imagine it.&rdquo; Andarist shook his head rather seriously and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not love. I&rsquo;m just very, very fond of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not in the habit of travelling without his entourage, there was no hiding his whereabouts from us. I soon learnt that he was in love with Jaen Enes&rsquo; daughter. They sauntered though wild lands, spent afternoons sitting by the river Dorssan Ryl, reading. When he invited her to a ball he was shy as a non-dancer, careful as if he were holding crystal. I once asked him jokingly if he had slept with her, and Andarist said not yet, because they didn&rsquo;t love each other enough and it would hurt both of them if they went any further.</p>
<p>I was amazed. Death is the killer of love, as our family had proven time and again. When Anomander was young, he had been madly in love with Hish Tulla, and I knew that he could not even bear to see her a moment later, so he had Gripp Galas look out for him, hiding from our father &hellip;&hellip; while I eavesdropped in the next room, holding back a laugh. Do you know how that relationship ended? The men went to fight the Jhelarkan War. Shortly after our return, I saw my brother sitting in the hall late at night, alone; on the table, a candle and a bottle of wine. I sat down next to him and asked him what had happened and he said that Hish had left him.</p>
<p>I tried to comfort him, saying that if she doesn&rsquo;t love long then her love doesn&rsquo;t value much. He stared straight at me, then shook his head, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, Silchas, you don&rsquo;t understand. It&rsquo;s not that she failed me, it is I who failed her. I can no longer love as I used to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years later, I approached Hish Tulla as if to try my brother&rsquo;s claim, only to find him right. We were happy enough together, but marriage? Don&rsquo;t even think about it. There was no need for a political merriage, let alone one out of love, as we couldn&rsquo;t imagine a future with each other. Could I really envision any future then? She was sharp and humourous, and I was considerate, we went here, attended that - but there was certain things we decided not to talk about by tacit agreement. Soon I found myself drinking in a corner like Anomander had done.</p>
<p>Now you know what a miracle Andarist was. He loved Enesdia, maybe even more than she loved him, who can say? I was never sharp when it came to such things. One fine day, Andarist put on his finest clothes and went by carriage to Jaen Enes&rsquo; house; Anomander understood and quickly sent an invitation to Enesdia. I watched her carefully that day as she took the hand of her maid and carefully got out of her carriage. Betrothal. Anomander played the role of a father in the rituals, and in addition volunteered a small fortune from his personal assets to build a new house between the two original holds for Andarist as a token of eternal friendship and his blessing. A gift to his dear brother. He was not only going to build a house, but to build a most beautiful one, having Azathanai to bless it and the best stonemasons to intall the hearthstone carved with prayers.</p>
<p>I closely watched Enesdia later on - I was a little disappointed - I felt that there were some flaws in her, that she was not the perfect woman my perfect brother deserved, and that she did not love him as much as he loved her. I thought - Abyss below, what did I think! You know what happened afterwards. The history of the Civil War. Of what I told you in the Wasteland, I expect her story to be one especially hard to forget.</p>
<p>Look at the flagstones beneath us. It has existed for far longer than you could imagine, yet looks almost new. It was a gift from Caladan Brood, blessed with Anomander&rsquo;s blood. The threshold over there is the work of Tiste and thus not so long-lasting - under it was buried my brother&rsquo;s betrothed.</p>
<h2 id="8-purake-1">8. Purake</h2>
<p>This is where I lived aeons ago. Strange, that it hardly collapsed. Rumours have it that K&rsquo;rul herself had blessed it, and I confess this seems true. Impressive people lived here - Sandalath, Andarist, whose stories I have already told you. I cannot tell you about Anomander - the pain is too recent and too great for me to talk about him yet. Whose story this time, then? Gripp Galas the god of my childhood, ever so tall, my teacher in the art of weapons whom I first defeated at the age of thirteen? Prazek and Dathenar, who used to wandered off somewhere when I was hardly more than a boy? I had followed Kellaras to find them, only to be dragged into the vice of lifelong drinking by the three in a bar under the bridge.</p>
<p>Hard to believe that you would hear about my parents. Well, I&rsquo;ll start with my father &hellip;&hellip; I don&rsquo;t actually remember much about him in this house. I remember him being tall, but maybe in fact he was a little shorter than me - or you. But much stronger. He was serious most of the time, but not lacking in kindness. If I could come up with some instances I will tell you later, on the way to Kharkanas. The deepest impression comes from the Forulkan War. Before Urusander&rsquo;s Legion joined the fight, the battles turned bad and forced my father and I into a withdrawal on a mountain road.</p>
<p>Anomander was with Andarist and had split up with us, too far to come to our aid. Among me and my father it seemed that one had to be sacrificed so that the other could survive. I called out to him over the din of the battlefield, I shall cover your retreat. You&rsquo;ll die that way, he cried and yelled. I knew what I needed to know about the situation in Kharkanas, about our King dying and leaving no heir, and I feared of a coop. I am expendable, I said, but Kharkanas needs you.</p>
<p>We held the entrance to the mountain road, thinking not of surviving but of dying slow. The retreat began in the morning, and by midday I had fifty men left, and twelve when the sun was sinking into the west. Then one by one they were cut down, and at dusk I was the only left; I was still a mortal then, and after a long day of bitter fighting there was no feeling in my hands, and my sword was so blunted that it could as well be a stick. It was then that I suddenly remembered - absurdly, but unbelievably clear even unto this day - a certain swordplay lesson, years ago, when my father and I had been playing around with blunted swords.</p>
<p>Alas, at the time I naively thought that saving him once would save the situation in our kingdom. I suppose those who wanted him dead were many, and not just on one side of the battle field. Worse, they were cunning enough not to kill him outright, but to cripple him. For many a years, my father was incapable of taking charge with Anomander unwilling to overstep his authority. Later I remember him as a sombre man on crutches, wandering about in our House as would a ghost. The civil war broke out within a few years of his death; we three had seen it coming, but had long since run out of time.</p>
<p>But now let me tell you about my mother. I still don&rsquo;t know who she is, only who she certainly isn&rsquo;t - Mother Dark, who nine out of ten people would think was my mother of birth; but she wasn&rsquo;t, we were her protectors instead. Menandore wasn&rsquo;t a good mother, and I understand that you didn&rsquo;t love her, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t need the concept of motherhood. Anomander seems to remember his mother - bits and pieces, and anyway, we were all very young when she left. I remember him and describing to me her face and voice, and some of her words, yet so much time has passed since then that I can&rsquo;t remember any of it &hellip;&hellip; if only I could ask him again &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, look at this corridor we&rsquo;re standing in now. The wooden structure of the windows has rotten all away, but I assure you that it was once made of the finest wood, carved by the most skillful craftsmen &hellip;&hellip; and these stone steps were then lustrous. The day I held to mountain pass, a miracle came to pass when Kagamandra Tulas&rsquo; cavalry suddenly charged behind the enemy, which saved my life. It was the first time he had ever saved me. I passed out on the way back to the barracks and woke up two days later, having had a long dream. In the dream I was standing where we are now, and my mother was sitting there, by the window then intact, at the end of the corridor, smiling and waiting for me. I trudged towards her like a toddler, seeing her face for the only time in my life.</p>
<h2 id="9-kharkanas-1">9. Kharkanas</h2>
<p>You said you envy me, Ryadd Eleis, for to me every location is as though an opened book. There is nothing to envy in grief, though from the outside it may seem beautiful. Do not envy me, please just watch from the outside and never wear my skin; it&rsquo;s enough to simply hear the stories of the fallen and wonder at the historical depth of these locations.</p>
<p>Instead I should envy you. For you, nowhere is tainted by memories, nowhere unfit to start a new life. I am jealous of you in a dark way, I am drawing strength from you. I love to listen to all your interrogations, all your incomprehensions, for they display the power of common sense untainted by remorse, for which you could never understand me, but all the better.</p>
<p>But though you cannot understand me, you keep listening. For this I am grateful to you, and admire you, and do not understand.</p>
<hr>
<p>Kharkanas is near. Has she announced herself in your mind? I have felt her.</p>
<p>I went to Caladan Brood to complete my vows before turning from her a second time. I have told you that she is not my mother. Again and again she called me, and again and again I left, under the excuse of teaching Nimander Golit the art of governance, or visiting Sandalath, or watching over the reconstruction of a certain part of the city, or whatever. Finally I could not escape any longer and I went to the Chamber of Night.</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin, my only remaining son - she called out to me - I have delayed too long. I will bless you, I will erase the grief from your soul.</p>
<p>I asked her in return why Anomander had to die.</p>
<p>She said that it was because one half of his soul was to tear the seal from the door, one half was to awaken the lifeless Kurald Galain, and the last wandering shred was to call her back.</p>
<p>I asked her why Anomander had to die.</p>
<p>She was silent and then said the answer I wanted to hear: because we were not good enough.</p>
<p>We were not good enough, I agreed, so you were in no position to bless me while I was in no position to curse you.</p>
<p>Eligibility is one thing - and Mother Dark didn&rsquo;t object. Had it been years ago, perhaps she would have banished me in anger. &ndash;but I have come back, I have the power to bless you, I have seen your grief and I can heal it&ndash;grief is nothing to envy, nothing to be prized.</p>
<p>But grief, though nothing to envy, is precious to me. I cannot imagine - Ryadd Eleis - I cannot imagine me not mourning for Anomander, or Tulas, or my lost friendship with Scara, or the unfortunate Andarist, and Sandalath and Killanthir and so many long-forgotten names and faces. Only grief enables me to remember them every day, a thousand times more profound than the sense of duty to history. How could I walk out of that room and accept her blessing and let those stories be no more than a piece of irrelevant history to me, those places no more than interesting ruins?</p>
<p>You said - and I answered her - that you asked me to remember.</p>
<p>I am asking you to remember, not to suffer. She called out behind me, but I slammed the door. It was the second time I did so.</p>
<p>But this time she did not curse my name, and I did not resolve never to return. Now Kharkanas is close at hand and I am back in a place I thought I could not bear to see. Thank goodness, now I find it bearable. Maybe I don&rsquo;t need to rely on her blessing anymore; maybe you have blessed me already.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is already Kharkanas at its brightest, Ryadd Eleis, and it&rsquo;s solely out of these lights. You will get used to it. My family has a house here, and now, out of respect, no one has encroached on it even an inch. But, unfortunately, there seems to be only one room in it that is habitable.</p>
<p>I will leave it to you; I can see that you are tired. When you are well rested -</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip; We&rsquo;ll do as you say. That will do.</p>
