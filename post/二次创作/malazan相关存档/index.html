<h3 id="一-thousand-facets-of-war">一 Thousand Facets of War</h3>
<p>#Silchas Ruin 视角，Malazan 和 MiddleEarth 的 Xover。</p>
<p>#OOC，特别OOC，有问题别打我，真的别打我</p>
<p>There are a thousand faces to the God of War, each one being worshipped in isolation, yet look at our battlefields, it is but a thousand temples to the selfsame madness.</p>
<hr>
<p>我做梦，我梦见战场。混乱降临人间，银蓝与血红的旌旗被践踏在一处，在血沼里浸泡得几乎看不出颜色。在交战双方的脸上，我看见惊恐、痛苦、讶异，以及释然。久经沙场之人无不释然于死亡。</p>
<p>这些面孔太过相似了。实际上，他们简直像极了 Tiste，即使 Tiste 一直少有鸦羽的长发与海灰的眼睛。我记起另一场战争，Tiste 对 Tiste，就在我们钟爱的王城下。那日的鲜血为我们铺成一条窄道，追随者们就这样跌跌撞撞地来到了一个新的世界，却不怀有幸存的渴望。</p>
<p>我本能地想要做些什么，亲族相残实在是一种最大的残忍。然而我没有刀剑，没有魔法，在此地不过是一个鬼魂。一对双生子领着士兵撤退进我所藏身的巷子，他们战斗的技巧既精确又娴熟，装备也好上许多，可是敌人为数众多，双生子的士兵则一个个地倒下。</p>
<p>“他们倒戈了，Ambarussa！”双生子中的一个叫道。</p>
<p>“就便如此也好，Ambarussa。”另一个平静地说，“免得我们做出更多恶事。”</p>
<p>我站在一旁，笃定自己的灵魂在梦中已经兀自飘荡，现在不知目睹的是何时何地的事件。自从 Azath 将我囚禁，最接近自由的时刻无过于此；我只是不明白为什么 Azath 允许我见证的总是悲剧。</p>
<p>长矛刺穿了平静者的链甲，刺入他胸口，把他钉在身后的木门上。他的兄弟尖叫，举起剑来，削下了袭击者的半个头骨。反手一剑刺穿了另一个人的喉咙。一把长刀割开了他的小臂，箭矢扎进了他的大腿。也就是从那个时候开始，他的步伐明显变得笨拙。很快，大大小小的伤口在他身上绽开：胁侧，小腿，头皮，肩膀。他滑下去，倒在自己兄弟的脚边。此时双生子的士兵已无一幸存，敌军像退潮一样撤出去，满地鲜血与骨骼。</p>
<p>“免得我们做出更多恶事。”双生子对着兄弟的尸体说。然后他竟然偏过头来，与我四目相对。“鬼魂，你过来！”他说，“我不知道你是谁，是第二家族的游魂还是辛达的怨灵，诸神的使者还是大敌的幻象，但求你不要让我一个人死去。”</p>
<p>我走到他身边，跪下，握住他的手。“这是哪里？”我问，“这是哪一场战争？”</p>
<p>双生子皱了皱眉：“他们说死亡会撕碎你的记忆，这样看来确实如此。这里是西瑞安河港，你所见证的是第三次也是最后一次亲族残杀。”</p>
<p>不会是最后一次，我想。那日在 Kurald Galain，我也以为是最后一次。然而，当 Scabandari 的匕首穿透我破碎的铠甲，当我倒在地上，听着我的士兵被屠戮，我就知道这种事情永远不会终结。</p>
<p>“这样也好。”他说，“是我和我的孪生兄弟挑起这场战争。我们追随着一颗受诅咒的宝石，东奔西跑，杀死一切拦路的人。我知道我们没法控制自己的怒火，但现在我们至少可以少做一些恶事。”</p>
<p>“愿你在死亡中找到安息。”我说。也只能如此。像你我这般罪恶深重的灵魂，除了死亡还有什么能让我们感到释然？</p>
<p>双生子带着笑容死去了，他的血凝固在暗红色披风里。我站起身来，揉搓双手以让其上的血迹褪去。周围一片寂静，这场战斗已经结束了。像每一场鏖战之后一样，空气中弥漫着沉重的血的腥味，和一丝腐朽的臭气。乌鸦从天而降，啄食死尸的眼睛。我看着这座毫无生机的河港，意识到又有一个文明走了和我们一样的路：他们自相残杀，最后在血泊中无可避免地走向毁灭。</p>
<p>于是我行走于战场上。我看到临海的高耸塔楼，双方士兵的尸体在此堆成小山。如果此地的统治者居住在高塔上，那倒确实是一幕奇景。我看到不着片甲的少女倒在路边，双手各拿一把厨刀，刀刃未尝卷折。她胸口一道细长的伤口，显然来自于扎穿了心肺的长剑。我看到母亲和女儿，父亲和儿子死在一处，我看到身佩相同徽记的士兵互相割开对方的喉咙。我为他们合上眼睛，记忆每一个人的面容。我看到身着破旧铠甲的士兵流着血，靠在无门的门框上。数不清他身上有多少创口，但他的右臂明显肿胀，显然已经多处骨折并感染。</p>
<p>“白色的幽灵，”他对我说，“请你陪伴我，不要让我独自死去。”</p>
<p>我顺从了他的心意，在他身边坐下。他把头靠在我肩膀上，我为他摘下头盔，发现其边缘是很漂亮的蓝色。</p>
<p>“你是谁？”我问，“这是哪一场战争？”</p>
<p>“我是 Gondolin 的 Enerdhil，我从城市的陷落中幸存，却死在了同族手里。”他叹息道，“我们，还有 Doriath 的遗民，一起流落到 Sirion 河口。定居不久，Feanorian 就威胁我们，让我们交出 Silmaril，否则就要动用武力。Elwing 拒绝了，于是他们就攻下了河港。我听说 Elwing 被杀了，他们夺走了 Silmaril，河港的幸存者逃到了 Balar 岛。”</p>
<p>“我会铭记你的话。”我说，“靠在我身上，我知道海岸就在近处。我们去海港，你去你说的那座岛屿，你所受的伤不至于死。”</p>
<p>——或许不至于死。我扯下他身上破碎的盔甲，把他扶起来。然而我们才走过三个院落的距离，Enerdhil 就滑了下去，再也无力起身。血沿着他前来的方向滴了一路。我们都知道时候到了。</p>
<p>“鬼魂，死亡是什么感觉？”他问我。</p>
<p>我心说我其实并没有死过，我的灵魂总是被困在这惨白的躯壳之中。最接近死亡的那一次，是在 Jelarkan 战争的一次伏击中。我们从早上奋战到中午，还好 Kagamandra Tulas 的援军及时赶到，否则就会全军覆没。早在敌军出现时我就知道我们要死了，坦白地说，那一瞬间的惊愕实在比任何重伤更加痛苦。</p>
<p>“最糟的时候已经过去了。”我说。</p>
<p>Enerdhil 看上去并不信服我的话，但善良的谎言或许本身就是安慰。一阵急促的呼吸，他的瞳孔逐渐散开，那双好看的蓝眼睛失去了神采。</p>
<p>我替他合上眼睛，决心铭记他所说的每一句话。在一个遥远的世界里曾有一座城名叫 Gondolin，他们失去她，是否就像我失去 Kharkanas？还有一个国度名叫 Doriath，那里的女人有没有 Hish Tulla 的奕奕神采，引得人们为她决斗？战争有许多面孔，我们称之为死亡、遗忘、漠然。我在我的时代里和它们成了朋友，但地狱在上，不必如此！</p>
<p>“Enerdhil。”我说，“我将会梦到你。”</p>
<p>有人从我身后来，我听见他脚步轻快，然而看到他的面容，我就知道那是个老兵。那双眼睛盛满了铁灰色的悲伤，以至于麻木。</p>
<p>“伤兵告诉我说，一个白色的幽灵穿梭在战场上，为将死之人合上眼睛。”他的声音像提琴，“我想问问你有没有看见我的兄弟？一对火红头发的孪生子，穿着暗红色的披风。如果一个死了，另一个也会和他在一处。”</p>
<p>“绕过高塔，在那边的巷子里。”我说，“他们的名字很奇怪，互相称呼为 Ambarussa。”</p>
<p>来者的视线落向一侧，像是不忍看我，只在此时我才在他身上捕捉到一点“人”的痕迹。“他们一直偏爱那个名字。”他叹道，“——谢谢你提供的消息。”</p>
<p>“那我也问你一个问题。”我诘问，“你知不知道一个叫 Elwing 的女人？她在战争中的命运如何？”</p>
<p>他沉默片刻，说：“我们亲眼看见她跳了海。”</p>
<p>我和这残忍的灵魂四目相对，他毫不畏缩，像是那颗心已经被灼烧殆尽。“但我要问问你她儿子的去向。你有没有看见两个小男孩，很小，大概……四五岁的样子？或者很小的脚印——什么都行。”</p>
<p>“然后你要做什么？”我说，“杀了他们吗？”</p>
<p>“Silmaril 不在他们手上，何必？”他诚恳地回答，“你看到过什么吗？”</p>
<p>“没有。”</p>
<p>我知道他知道这不是个诚恳的回答，因为无论我看见了什么都会给出否定回答。这提琴一般的恶魔转过身去，刚走了几步又停下来。“如果你是个不知来自何方的历史学家，想知道这里发生了什么，或许当你厌倦了漫游于战场，可以去城外找我的哥哥，就问 Maedhros 殿下在哪里。”停顿，“我会很感激。他是这场战争的指挥官。”</p>
<p>说完他就走了。</p>
<p>有人喊叫，说 Balar 的船来了。尔后轻伤的士兵搀扶重伤者，姗姗来迟的援军抬着担架，构成一条红与白的长龙。也只有此时才能看到此地战争独特的残忍。你能看见凹陷的头颅、刺穿胸廓的肋骨、从肩膀处消失的手臂，然而这些人都活着。几近不可能。我伫立于高塔之上，试图记忆这战争的千张脸孔——一个民族的欢笑、决心与血泪。</p>
<p>太阳西斜之时，救援任务已近尾声，冷却的尸体被纵火焚烧，空气里布满了灰烬的气味和脂肪的香气。这时这座城池真正安静了，只除了几只不满的乌鸦。我终于决定前往弑亲者的营地，去见见那个指挥官。我循着提琴师的指示询问，很快就抵达了他的营帐。他背对着我，低头阅读军事地图，我注意到他没有右手。</p>
<p>“你是谁？”他没有转头，问。</p>
<p>我说：“我不过是个过客，我梦到了你们而已。”</p>
<p>“那很好。”他说，“我们一定是最可怕的噩梦，但你总有醒来的时候。”</p>
<p>“并非如此。”我说，“当我做梦时，我的灵魂就会脱离被囚禁的躯壳，带我到不同的时间和地点。我不过是你们世界的过客，转瞬即逝的游魂。”</p>
<p>“士兵说城中有个苍白的鬼魂，其高尚之举让他们心生惭愧。”他说，“是 Kanafinwe 让你来的吗？作为一个预兆，预示着你很快也要合上我的眼睛？那就来吧，刀在桌上。我会对你心存感激。”</p>
<p>我不知道 Kanafinwe 是谁。我说：“我只想问几个问题，这是哪一场战争？”</p>
<p>“我和我的兄弟们发誓要夺回父亲制造的 Silmarils，不管阻拦我们的是谁。”他说，“我们身为王子，带着族人踏上了一场无希望的远征，讨伐黑暗大敌。当我们失败时，我们就转向其他持有 Silmaril 的人，上一次在 Doriath 的森林里毁灭了他们的国度，这一次把 Sirion 河口夷为平地。然而 Elwing 带着 Silmaril 跳了海，我们无谓的战争结束了。我们犯下了全世界独一份的罪恶。”</p>
<p>说完他又去研究军事地图。</p>
<p>“那你还在规划什么战役？”我问。</p>
<p>“我们渴望释然。”他说，“我要最后一次带着他们向黑暗大敌发起冲锋，尽管一定会在半道上全军覆没。我要追寻那两枚还在这片大陆上的 Silmaril，为了完成誓言而死。尽管做出此等不义之事，我希望我的残部能带着光荣的幻象死去，Beleriand 最后一支军队能勇敢而死。”</p>
<p>窗外下起了雨。我听到有人在歌唱。</p>
<p>“我会记住你的话。”我说。</p>
<p>红发的将领发出一阵低笑：“我不是那种会食言的人。”</p>
<p>我说：“仅仅是以防你在战争中死去，此后无人记得。但我劝你不要这么做，只因为你们犯下的不是独一份的罪恶。我也曾是将领，我带着一群仓促训练的罪犯，和我的朋友在 Kharkanas 门口兵戎相见。我曾经背叛我的兄长，在他最需要我的时候撤退，带着子民来到另一片地域。在那里，我们针对异族进行种族屠杀，K&rsquo;Chain Che&rsquo;Malle 消亡在我们手下。然后背叛再起，我竭力拯救的子民全部埋骨他乡。我曾经漫游过无数梦境，我梦见暴君将一整片大陆烧成灰烬。我梦见女人被绑在火刑柱上烧死。我梦见一朵形状奇怪的云和几十万亡魂的合唱。你们所犯下的罪恶不过是这个时代最坏的一部分，然而每个时代也都有最坏的一部分。”</p>
<p>“如果你真像你所说的那样十恶不赦，”他说，“你为什么还能为那些士兵合上眼睛？”</p>
<p>“我热切地期待着死。”我说，“我知道如果我们三兄弟中有一个该死的，那应该是我。但是在死亡找上我之前，我希望能做些……补救。救赎。”</p>
<p>他转过身，我第一次与他四目相对。铁灰色的眼睛，瘦削的面部轮廓，一片残忍地悬挂着的火红头发。他比我还高一点。</p>
<p>“你的话中有智慧。”他说，“我会保存我的兵力，等时机到来，我们或许还能给出致命一击。毕竟，这是 Beleriand 最后一个军事组织。至于救赎……”</p>
<p>轻快的脚步声。</p>
<p>提琴师抱着两个孩子出现在我们身后，他们明显是双胞胎，身上有血，面容却还健康。一个警惕地盯着 Maedhros，另一个已经陷入沉睡。</p>
<p>“嗯，你可以称他们为救赎。”提琴师说。</p>
<h2 id="二-cussered-eleint">二 Cussered Eleint</h2>
<p><em>非常 OOC，纯粹为了自己爽而写。战损预警。向 Silchas Ruin 道歉，希望他不要夜里来我梦里把我掐死或者砍死。碎碎念部分有剧情简介 aka 剧透。</em></p>
<hr>
<p>白色 Eleint 在山坡上迫降，还未站稳就在一阵血雾中化为人形。就着落日的余晖，Silchas 检查了一下自己的伤势，感到不容乐观。他的双臂裹在自己的血里，红浆沿着皮肤滑落，从手指滴下，将力量与体温尽数化为草丛里的深色污迹。那条拨开第一个 Cusser 的腿没断，真是万幸。然而淤血在关节和肌肉间游荡，加上嵌入血肉中的陶片，甫一压上体重，剧痛就像白热的箭矢一般刺穿伤腿。躯干内部阵阵绞痛，他猜想是震荡伤，大约有内出血。</p>
<p>万幸剑还在，他沉闷地想。说不上趁手，比起先前的兵刃也算不上强大，然而此刻他身被数创，盔甲残破，更为这世界的繁杂而惊恐——或许也悔恨。于身体、精神、盔甲和剑中，剑竟然是最忠诚的那个。</p>
<p>Silchas 跌跌撞撞地朝山谷走。山谷里有树，以他的状态，或许树上是他能找到的最安全的过夜处。何况他闻见了溪水。水总是必要的，用来清创，用来饮用。不过大约得小心，他流了太多血，如果再将血液喂给溪水，Silchas Ruin 将不能从卵石河床上起身。</p>
<p>黄昏将至，树影舞蹈。Silchas 继续下坡。他的视野在变暗。只是日落吗？他想。一阵痉挛的疼痛猝然抓住了伤者，伤腿也适时背叛了他。Silchas Ruin 咒骂半句，口中涌起血的腥味，片刻后洒在草地上的液体被余晖照得发黑。这次他清楚了：不只是日落。他的视野飞速地暗淡下去，冰冷的黑暗由四周向他发起猛攻。这不像 Kurald Galain 的黑夜，这里不是他的家，一个陌生的国度——</p>
<p>自他饮下龙血以来的第一次，Silchas Ruin 认真地考虑起死亡。</p>
<p>龙血给人力量，龙血使人傲慢，让人以为他们战无不胜，以为时间冲刷他们就像山洪卷过山脉，我自岿然不动。当他背对着 Scabandari 站在山坡上，等待着背叛和囚禁，Silchas 天真地以为那只不过是打个盹。等到他醒来，他将自然而然地拥有原来的力量和地位。仿佛什么都没有发生。</p>
<p>现在他知道自己错了。在他离开的那些年，时间兀自流转，帝国建立又崩塌。新的魔法体系出现了，新的技术使人类也能轻易杀死 Ascendants，像他这样的古老而傲慢的生物。他们不自知日光之下已经没有他们的位置。</p>
<p>我会死在这里吗？他扪心自问。或者不如说，死是一种难以接受的结局吗？他还有什么未竟的事业吗？对 Azath 的誓言已经完成了，Scabandari 受了比他严酷得多的刑罚，旧的错误自有新人来弥补，世界大约已经没有旧神的位置。</p>
<p>“Silchas. ”</p>
<p>有人叫他。那人片刻之前还不在这里，Silchas 不知道他是怎么悄无声息地摸到他的身后——也不该很难，他疲倦伤重，另一人又本来就比他强大。</p>
<p>Silchas 沙哑地回答：“Anomander. ”</p>
<p>他哥哥站在他背后，不消说，衣甲齐备，身材笔直，身上天然有种让人信任的特质：如果山洪到来，Anomander 就是山体本身，你无法想象他会动摇。</p>
<p>Silchas 说：“如果你想为我的背叛责罚我，兄长，现在我无力反抗。”</p>
<p>“怎么会呢？”他哥哥带着那种熟悉的神秘的微笑回应，“Silchas，我早已原谅你了。”</p>
<p>Anomander 在草坪上跪下，把幼弟扶起来，让伤者的头靠着自己的肩膀。他修长灵活的手指熟练地压上 Silchas 上臂的止血点，那里的衣物已经被先前的爆炸全部撕碎。Silchas 挂在他身上，感到动脉一次次冲撞着自己的肱骨。Anomander 的手很稳。双臂的伤口渗血逐渐缓慢，年长者慢慢放松了力道。万幸，红色的液体没有再一次涌出来——天知道还剩下多少可流。</p>
<p>“我想你有几根肋骨裂开了。”Anomander 的手指抚过他的身体，以进行检查，“里面可能有伤。你的腿要等几天，如果 Caladan 在就好了……万幸骨头没事。是谁把你搞成了这副样子？”</p>
<p>“几个人类。”Silchas 沮丧地承认道，“拿着会爆炸的石头，在 Letheras。我的翅膀碎了。”</p>
<p>“那是 Malazan 士兵常用的武器，叫 Cusser，确实……很难缠。”Anomander 说，“他们的创造力总是让人惊叹——你想要水吗？我会带你到溪边。”</p>
<p>失血总是让人口渴，这不是个他能拒绝的提议。于是 Anomander 扶起 Silchas，承担了伤者大部分的体重。在他们前方，日落后的溪水呈现出深色，让人想起 Dorssan Ryl.</p>
<p>在黑夜之中，Silchas 感受着兄长的体温，他坚实的存在。说不出这是一种什么感受，多年以后的第一次见面，被看到的是最狼狈的样子。然而 Anomander 就在他身旁，步履坚定，毫不在意斗篷沾满同胞兄弟的血。</p>
<p>他们走到河边，Silchas 喘息着躺倒在石板上，感到阵阵晕眩。Anomander 投来一个恼人的关切眼神，然后下去给水囊装满水，凑到胞弟唇边。伤者喝了。</p>
<p>“你是怎么找到我的？”他问。</p>
<p>Anomander 神秘地笑着，仿佛笑容本身就是回答。“我们是兄弟啊。”良久，他说。</p>
<p>说完他就踱步到溪边，Silchas 闭眼就能想象兄长站在卵石上，沉默着微笑着看溪水。为伤者守夜。然而他听见 Anomander 说：“不要睡。”</p>
<p>那声音充满哀伤。他感到反常，支起上半身，骨裂处为此尖叫抱怨，让他眼前发黑。Anomander 背对着他站在溪水中，像一把银柄的黑剑，靴子被水流打湿，他却仿佛浑然不觉。“Silchas. ”他的兄长说，“不要睡。我们该谈谈。”</p>
<p>说完他兀自发言：“你或许觉得这个时代太陌生了，崭新。但我们今日所为，大多都与过往有千丝万缕的联系。”年长者顿了一下。“——过往的错误。我要出发去纠正一个远古时代的过失了，Silchas Ruin。我想在这一时代里，你也感受到了这种……必要性。”</p>
<p>“我感受到了。”他嗫嚅。他想到了 Kaminsod，四分五裂，忍受剧痛，被缚于大地之血肉，被恶人崇拜。——倘若没有那些人，这受伤的神灵大约早已痊愈。</p>
<p>“我感到所有这些事都纠缠在一处。”Anomander 说，“这一次，没有人能独善其身。所以，我的兄弟，我有个不情之请。活下来，做正当的事，若应该战斗就去战斗。”</p>
<p>Silchas 明白他的意思。</p>
<p>“Ryadd Eleis. ”他说，Anomander 背对着他点点头。</p>
<p>Silchas 只是盯着兄长的背影。莫名其妙地，藏在他头脑角落里的那个声音在提醒他：这不对劲。那个声音说：这听起来像——</p>
<p>“Anomander. ”他沙哑道，“我不会睡着。留下来。Anomander, 留下。”</p>
<p>他的兄长走到他身边，在岩石上坐下，用手指抹去他唇边的血迹。他嘴唇上一抹若有若无的哀伤的笑容。“我们为责任而活，Silchas，我们做我们所当做的。”</p>
<p>然后 Anomander 的手指抚过他的额头，然后 Anomander 站起身，沿着他们来时的路上山。他走过 Silchas 留下的血迹，他在身后留下一串湿湿的鞋印，他走上了山脊。月亮在他背后升起，正形成一个正圆。</p>
<p>“活下来。”</p>
<p>——然后他向自己的胞弟挥了挥手，然后他消失了。</p>
<hr>
<p>Silchas 脸朝下趴在地上，顺带着谋杀了一片野草。太阳已经落下去了，此时天光昏暗，明月高悬。他身下的泥土潮湿，散发着血腥气。——血，或许还有内脏碎片。</p>
<p>Anomander 没有来过。他刚才只是昏过去了，做了个过于真实的梦。不过那是个好梦。</p>
<p>他感到双臂的表面已经不再滑了，一种烦人的黏性取而代之，提示他出血已经停止。今天的第一个好消息。Silchas 呻吟着翻身坐起来，背靠粗粝的树干。失血让人感到口渴，他喉咙里像是有火在烧，其他伤处争相疼痛，几乎要把他淹没。</p>
<p>在黑夜之中，那条并不存在的路无比清晰：它引向山谷，引向那条深色的河流。Silchas 估摸着自己能不能走下去。或许他会需要爬下去。他要给自己清创，止血。把腿上的陶瓷片挑出来。喝一些水，如果运气好的话，刺穿一条鱼。用法术把自己扔到树上，用剩下的衣服绑好。然后睡一会。</p>
<p>然后活下来。</p>
<p>还有事情要做，他想。然后等这一场剧变过去，我要见见 Andarist 和 Anomander。天知道我们上一次见面是什么时候。对，我要确确实实地见见 Andarist，还有 Anomander。</p>

<p><em>碎碎念（又名我自己给自己写评论系列）：</em></p>
<p><em>之前 Silchas 打算单人削平 Letheras 城，结果飞上去了之后吃了两发绑着 Cusser（一种炸弹）的爆炸箭，被打了下来，后靠魔法逃生。他自述“差点死了”。在这次遭遇之后，他前往 Refugium 成为 Rud Elalle 的导师，并命名其为 Ryadd Eleis。</em></p>
<p><em>Anomander 的计划大致如此。他的剑 Dragnipur 内有一个次元，被剑杀死的人都会进去。这些人身上绑着锁链，以拖拽一辆巨大的马车，马车上是通往 Kurald Galain 的门。马车后面，Chaos 始终追赶着。一旦 Chaos 涌入大门，就会发生巨大的危机。Anomander 停止杀戮以让 Chaos 赶上马车，杀死了大部分拖车人员，但他引入了 Hood 的军队，把守大门一段时间。随后他牺牲自己走进了大门，以灵魂为代价向 Mother Dark（一位神明）祈求，而她将大门移走了。</em></p>
<p><em>据我观察，卷八 Anomander（即计划自我牺牲的那个时期）肯定不是哭哭啼啼的，但他毕竟热爱生命。前期他挣扎的迹象不明显，但我觉得有。</em></p>
<p><em>Andarist 被扔在 Drift Avalii 守王座，卷四就死了。aka 他这时候已经死了，Silchas 可能还不知道或者不敢相信。</em></p>
<p><em>穿着靴子踩水致敬卷八 Anomander 召见 Spinnock 的时候<del>因为腿太长</del>不慎把靴子伸进火炉（不过他倒是没事，毕竟喝过龙血的人都有徒手扒拉篝火的习惯）。</em></p>
<p><em>Anomander 翻过山脊消失完全照抄了他和 Endest Silann 的告别。</em></p>
<p><em>Silchas 的预感我不用再说是什么了吧。我个人感觉他在听说哥死之前应该就猜到了些什么，不然一不符合其智商和法力（Black Coral 的所有人在 Anomander 死的时候可是立刻感觉到了），二不能解释他一听见 Olar Ethil 说 Rake 死了就自抱自泣而不是削死对方再哭。</em></p>
<p><em>那条河在这里是一个隐喻，象征生命（这么无聊的东西我为什么要写）。水是生命之源大家节约用水哦。</em></p>
<p><em>提醒一句，如果你们遇到休克病人（我觉得白鸦被炸成这样虽然没烧伤但是出血绝对够了），不要随便挪动（像 Rake 那样），保持头低脚高，不要喂食喂水。止血是要的。</em></p>
<p><em>最后，玛拉兹的梦境是很奇妙的东西。Udinass 梦见自己被 Menandore 上了，不久后 Menandore 就生下了 Rud Elalle。所以兄弟俩虽然不在同一片大陆，也算是见了最后一面吧，弥补一下一个巨大的意难平。</em></p>

<p>The bone-white Eleint landed heavily on the slope, sembling in mists of blood before it managed to stand still. With the last of the sun&rsquo;s rays, Silchas Ruin examined his wounds, which are bad. His arms were sheathed in his own blood, the red fluid even now dripping from the fingertips, taking away his strength and sending through him a shiver he couldn&rsquo;t repress. The leg with which he pushed aside the first explosive arrow was fortunately unbroken, yet the bruises and the shards stuck in the leg made him wince whenever he tried to set weight upon the damaged limb. A churning pain resided within his torso. Concussion perhaps, and internal bleeding.</p>
<p>Lucky that his swords remained, he thought dully. Not quite handy, powerfull even less, yet look at him now: battered and confused. Of this injured body, this perplexed mind, those broken armour and his new twin swords, the latest are mockingly the most loyal.</p>
<p>He stumbled towards the valley. There are trees which could shelter him against the possible rain, and he had smelled water, which is critical. Water is always needed for drinking and the cleansing of wounds, even if for both purposes he&rsquo;d preferred wine. But beware, he had lost much blood already. Waste any more and Silchas Ruin wouldn&rsquo;t be able to rise from the cobbled riverbed.</p>
<p>Now the dusk is nigh and the shadows danced. Silchas Ruin continued his descent, his vision darkening. Is it only because of the setting sun? He wondered. Then a wave of pain clenched him, his wounded leg betraying him at the same instant. Cursing, Silchas Ruin fell, with a dire taste of blood in his throat. At once the ground shone black with the blood he just coughed up, and now with the world quickly darkening around him he knew it wasn&rsquo;t just the sun. This cold, cold darkness felt nothing like home, it&rsquo;s an invitation from an alien realm.</p>
<p>Doubled over, for the first time since he took the Eleint blood, Silchas Ruin thought seriously about Death.</p>
<p>The blood of the Eleint provided both power and arrogance, it made its drinkers think that they were unstoppable, that against them time were but like a creek running down a vast mountain, and how could such a creek take down the monolith? When he had been standing on that heap of carcasses, his back exposed to Scabandari, he had thought that a visit to the Azath was nothing more than a nap, that upon his return his power and status and responsibilities would return too, all at once. As if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>And now he knew he had been wrong. In the years of his absence, time flowed on. Empires rose and crumbled. New warrens were found. New technologies enabled the mortal to slay an Ascendant, old men like him who were so arrogant that they didn&rsquo;t even realise there is no place for them in this realm any longer.</p>
<p>Will I die here? He mused. Or, more appropriately, does that even matter? Are there things undone yet? My vow to the Azath is fulfilled, the Gates to Starvald Demelain sealed. Scabandari had paid well too high for his ancient betrayal, and all the old wrongs shall be righted by new hands, none of which his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silchas. &quot;</p>
<p>Someone called him, someone who wasn&rsquo;t there mere moments ago. Silchas didn&rsquo;t know how he closed in so soundlessly, but alas, that shouldn&rsquo;t be hard, for he was exhausted and wounded, and Anomander Rake was ever the superior among them two.</p>
<p>He rasped an reply, &ldquo;Anomander. &quot;</p>
<p>His brother stood behind him, of course clad in fine armour, tall as mountains and straight as an cedar, forever inviting blind faith in him. It is easy to believe that in an mountain torrent Anomander would be the mountain itself, that he wouldn&rsquo;t even waver in the fiercest storms in both imagination and reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, if you are here to give answer to my betrayal, &ldquo;He said bitterly, &ldquo;obviously I&rsquo;m in no shape to resist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious. &ldquo;His brother replied, supposedly with an enigmatic smile playing on his lips, &ldquo;How could you not think that I have forgiven you long, long ago? &quot;</p>
<p>And so Anomander knelt on the grass, lifted his injured brother so that Silchas&rsquo; head is supported by the older one&rsquo;s shoulder. His long fingers pressed on the arteries on Silchas&rsquo; upper arm, where armour and clothes were already torn away by the explosions. Silchas leaned weakly against him, feeling the arteries pulse against his humerus and his brother&rsquo;s unwavering hand. The bleeding ebbed and ceased, and Anomander gently lifted the pressure. Fortunately, it didn&rsquo;t resume, else Silchas doubted there&rsquo;d be any blood left in him soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few broken ribs, lucky that you broke nothing else. &ldquo;Anomander examined and commented, &ldquo;Bleedings from the intestines. Your leg wouldn&rsquo;t function until a few days later. If only Caladan is here&hellip; how did you get yourself into this? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few mortals. &ldquo;He admitted in a whisper, humiliation blazing in his chest. &ldquo;Explosive arrows, in Letheras. Shredded both wings. &quot;</p>
<p>Fortunately Anomander didn&rsquo;t press to ask why he was even back there, or perhaps it was because his brother just knew. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a weapon named Cusser, used by the Malazans and the Moranth. &ldquo;He explained, &ldquo;Tricky indeed. Humans always humble us with their bright creativity, don&rsquo;t they? Oh, do you need water? I can help you down into the valley. &quot;</p>
<p>Blood loss leads to desperate thirst, so this wasn&rsquo;t a suggestion he could reject. Thus Anomander helped him up, taking most of his weight as they began this not-so-long descent. Afore them the waters was painted black by the sinking sun, reminiscent of Dorssan Ryl.</p>
<p>In the darkness, he yearned for Anomander&rsquo;s reassuring heat, his solid presence. He felt indeed humiliated for reuniting with his brother after all those years in such an uncomely state, yet Anomander stood gracefully, not bothered by the blood that stained the cloak he wore.</p>
<p>They reached the shore of the now-broad river and Silchas collapsed onto a boulder, chest heaving and dazed. Anomander cast an irritatingly caring look, and set off to refill the bladder with water. He then put it to Silchas&rsquo; lips and the injured Andii drank deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find me? &quot; Silchas asked.</p>
<p>Anomander smiled his enigmatic smile, as if that is the answer to all questions possible. At length, he said, &ldquo;Why, we are brothers. &quot;</p>
<p>Then he sauntered to the river bank. Silchas closed his eyes, but could still see clearly that silent, smiling figure staring at the dark waves. Standing vigil for his wounded brother. Yet he heard Anomander say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a tone ripe with sorrow. Noticing this abnormality, he sat up despite the pain lancing through this battered body. Anomander stood in the shallows, like a silver-hilted sword of black driven into the riverbank. His boots were engulfed by water, a fact he seemingly failed to realise.</p>
<p>And then Anomander said, as if to himself, &ldquo;Perhaps you find this time perplexing, since it&rsquo;s new to your eyes. Yet you will find that what we encounter today are all connected to our past. &ldquo;A short pause. &ldquo;&ndash;Ancient faults, one of which I am setting about to right. Silchas Ruin, I believe you also have felt such&hellip; necessities. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. &ldquo;He muttered, remembering the broken visage of Kaminsod. Scattered, chained, in pain and worshipped by those evil worshippers without whom he would long since have healed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these things are converging. &ldquo;Said Anomander, &ldquo;This time none shall stand aside. So, my brother, I shall ask this of you: Survive and do what you must, what you should. Fight if for a worthy cause. &quot;</p>
<p>And he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ryadd Eleis. &ldquo;He replied, to see a nod from his brother.</p>
<p>And he stared at the dark figure, and he heard a voice deep within his head. Telling him that this is wrong, telling him the words exchanged had been too much like a&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anomander. &ldquo;He rasped, &ldquo;Stay. I won&rsquo;t fall asleep. Stay, brother. Stay. &quot;</p>
<p>And so his brother walked to the boulder on which he was lying, and bent over to wipe the gore from his pallid lips. Smiling that enigmatic smile of his. &ldquo;We do as necessity dictates, Silchas, we do what we must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And those fingers of midnight brushed his brow, and his brother stood, tracing the track they walked just now. He walked past the blood left by Silchas Ruin, leaving behind a wet trail of footprints, all the way to the ridge. And the moon rose behind him, a perfect cirle around his lean shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Survive. &quot;</p>
<p>And he waved toward his brother, and vanished.</p>
<hr>
<p>Silchas Ruin laid prostrate on the humid soil, said humidity presumably from his own blood. Down went the sun, leaving the dome lightless save for the full moon now rising.</p>
<p>Anomander had never came. A dream, a vision way to real conjured in his unconsciousness. A good dream though.</p>
<p>His arms were no longer slick with blood, an irritating stickness now claiming them, indicating that the bleeding had ceased. A good news for the day. Moaning, he sat up and leaned against a rough tree trunk. Blood loss always leads to desperate thirst, a incessant fire that burned his throat. The varied wounds screamed, threatening to overwhelm him.</p>
<p>In the darkness, that non-existant road gleamed true. Leading to the valley with the creek painted dark by the moon. Silchas wondered if he could walk down there. Perhaps he would have to drag himself eventually, but no matter. He will drink, and clean up the wounds. Remove all the clay from that injured leg. Get a fish if possible. Make a fire. Set wards, and sleep, and wait for the fever to come.</p>
<p>And suivive this close lesson and learn.</p>
<p>So many things yet undone, he thought to himself. And when this conflagration is over, I shall meet my brothers. Hood knows when we last met. Aye, I will see them, in spirit and in flesh, perhaps even in a tavern. Andarist, and Anomander.</p>
<h2 id="三-what-did-ryadd-cook">三 What did Ryadd Cook</h2>

<p>依旧是迫害白鸦文学……对不起，真的对不起。</p>
<p>As the dark unfolded, Ryadd Eleis decided he should do something. Silchas Ruin was still curled around his agony motionlessly and as far as Ryadd knew, an Andii as he is could stay like that for weeks. With this most unexpected parley coming to past, leaving his teacher broken like this, he was suddenly at a lost for what to do next.</p>
<p>Build a fire first, then. Although Silchas Ruin seemed impervious to the weather, Ryadd always preferred a campfire crackling nearby. He unfolded his satchel, took out the dried branches they collected days ago, and headed over to a small hill nearby to set a fire, since he decided to camp there tonight.</p>
<p>His hands were ones for conjuring flames. With the campfire burning steadily behind him, Ryadd walked back to where his teacher remained. He grabbed Silchas by one hand which was clenched into a fist and easily pulled him up, since the gaunt Tiste Andii was in no mind to resist him. Silchas Ruin slowly uncurled, his eyes flat and lifeless, as if his soul had already left him to wander beside Anomander Rake.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This couldn&rsquo;t be.&rsquo; He heared Ruin murmur, &lsquo;It musn&rsquo;t be as what it seems.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Words failed Ryadd when he sought to console his companion, who had embraced the poisonous wine of delusion to perchase himself but a moment of peace. So instead he just dragged him uphill. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all over now.&rsquo; He grunted, embarrassed by his own words. Silchas Ruin followed him in the manner of a puppet, and when they reached the campsite, he just fell immobile again, staring blankly into the flames.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have burned, I believe, what&rsquo;s left of our reserves.&rsquo; At length, Ruin observed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;True.&rsquo; Ryadd replied, &lsquo;Anyway, you said we could just veer whenever we have need of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&hellip;On a night when we don&rsquo;t have much to cook.&rsquo; Ruin&rsquo;s voice drifted away, &lsquo;Curious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Ryadd squatted down beside their satchels and fumbled at what little food they have, he caught a glimpse of his teacher kneeling beside the campfire and stirring the embers with his hands. On his palms and nails were dark glistenings and he immediately recognised them as blood.</p>
<p>He averted his gaze. Since the moment Torrent had left, he had tried to fathom and relate to his teacher&rsquo;s pain, had sought to use anything, words or embraces or both, to help him through the disaster. But Silchas Ruin was a man of solitude, and while he struggled to navigate his inner tumult, Ryadd could but watch.</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin had retreated from the campfire and was slapping his hands free of embers when Ryadd held the pot over the fire to boil whatever was in it. The fire flickering between them, he said nervously, &lsquo;I want to hear about Anomander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His teacher sat across him, still staring at the flame. &lsquo;Be careful.&rsquo; He murmured, &rsquo;lest you overcook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ryadd hesitated, but then he steadied himself and said in a clear voice, &lsquo;Tell me of your brother, Silchas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tis no use.&rsquo; The Andii met his gaze and replied slowly, in a tone devoid of emotions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was he formidable? &lsquo;Ryadd went on despite his companion&rsquo;s apparent refusal. Impatience flared to life in Ruin&rsquo;s blood-red eyes as he snapped, &lsquo;Why do you press me so? What do you seek in a sad tale of mine? Would you entertain yourself with my blood and tear? Or do you seek to pity me, to indeed <em>surpass</em>? I&rsquo;ve enough grief in me to break you should I pour them out. Is this what you want? '</p>
<p>And Ryadd saw clearly the apparition stalking them from the very beginning of the journey. He well remembered the history lessons Silchas Ruin had given him, yet only then had he understood the pain those tales promised, when the teller had indeed lived through them. In this gaunt man&rsquo;s wake was countless friendships severed, betrayals exacted. A brother was driven mad before his eyes and a civilisation crumbled.</p>
<p>Could he but relate to him? Ryadd wondered. He had lost a mother but indeed, he didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The anger in Ruin&rsquo;s eyes was cold, yet it burned. Ryadd so wanted to flee, into a hunting or into taking care of the stew between them. But another part of him urged him on. He had stood vigil over his grief-stricken teacher and that made them somehow equal, so he had to finish what he started, repair what he broke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I but want to assure you that you do not mourn alone.&rsquo; He said after consideration.</p>
<p>He heard a eerie, almost animal sound from across the campfire, followed by silent sobs. Only then did he notice the tears running hot down his cheeks. Ryadd edged past the campfire and sat down beside his teacher, who immediately sagged against his shoulder. Moments later wetness seeped through his clothing and lingered like blood.</p>
<p>Ryadd held the shuddering form of Silchas Ruin in his arms. Held fast. He felt the muscles clench and ebb, and finally Ruin answered his embrace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not mourn alone.&rsquo; He tried to sound firm, &lsquo;Tell me of Anomander Rake, so that I can mourn with you. I am no stranger to losses and I will bear your wound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin straightened with a bitter smile on his lips. He stretched out his legs and sighed, &lsquo;Since the day of my release I had been envisioning this: After the war, after my perish, Anomander would sit with Caladan Brood over a campfire. They&rsquo;d bring casks of Tiste wine or a potent Thel Akai brew. Anomander would mourn for me and Andarist, but not explicitly, since that wasn&rsquo;t in him from his birth. There&rsquo;d be grief and the burdens of the sword and the hammer would remain, but at least, there&rsquo;d be peace. And they&rsquo;d honour&hellip; memories.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hear you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was&hellip; honourable. Formidable and reassruing, aye.&rsquo; Ruin murmured, &lsquo;True to his words yet not unready to forgive. And even with the burden of a thousand realms atop his shoulders, why, his but smiles and dances beneath the chains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The loss of such a brother must be unbearable, Silchas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, long ago had I lost another one. I will bear it nonetheless. Alas, I shall have to tell you more of him some other day, because your pot protests.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the smile on those pallid lips flicked wicked. Ryadd Eleis frowned at seeing the contents of the pot already gone black, with an unpleasant smell wafting forth. Behind him Silchas Ruin said in a calm voice beneath which flowed pain, &lsquo;Words fail me when I sought to properly thank you for what you have done for me, Ryadd Eleis. Every day on the journey you manage to surprise me, and I am honoured to have been your companion. Even if we find ourselves on different sides in the war to come, I will not willingly cross you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stunned, he stared down the wreckage of the pot.</p>
<p>Silchas Ruin sighed. &lsquo;Too bad we have nothing for supper. Try to sleep with an empty stomach, Ryadd, while I stand the first watch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wind buffeted at him, the campfire wavered, and he knew Silchas Ruin had veered. A shadow shrouded him and moments later, the bone-white dragon began its circling ascent.</p>
<p>Ryadd laid down beside the dying fire. He knew far too well that Silchas Ruin wouldn&rsquo;t wake him up anytime tonight. Yet staring into the embers and envisioning the face of Olar Ethil, he discovered that Silchas Ruin wouldn&rsquo;t be the only sleepless Soletaken Eleint left on this lifeless plain.</p>

<hr>
<p>Skillen Droe eyed the man who carried a satchel yonder suspiciously. There was no mistaking K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s power as it emanated from him, yet as far as Skillen was concerned K&rsquo;rul should be a <em>woman</em>.</p>
<p>He approached the cloaked figure. K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s hood half obscured the strangely masculine but still familiar face. &ldquo;Hello, Skillen.&rdquo; He said casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you to be female.&rdquo; Skillen replied suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m done with birthing for a time.&rdquo; The cloaked Azathanai waved a dismissive hand, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re curious, Erratas is my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Skillen frowned, &ldquo;Even among us, it&rsquo;s queer to alter your sex from time to time, you know. And I prefer you the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of sex, you remind me of our purpose of meeting.&rdquo; K&rsquo;rul cut in, &ldquo;Although I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t enjoy doing it out here&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cottage rose in front of them. Skillen admired it, admitting that K&rsquo;rul had always been the better of him when it came to magic. K&rsquo;rul strolled to its door, kicked it open, as if to test the hinges, and then walked in with Skillen trailing behind, who looked around. A gloom commanded the cottage and few were the furnishings, a plain bed, a table, a chair and little else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This night should be an experiment.&rdquo; The Maker announced, &ldquo;Skillen, do whatever you want to me, conjure whatever you need, I won&rsquo;t protest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that include&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It made him excited thinking of dominating K&rsquo;rul. Among the first-generations, K&rsquo;rul was considered as one of the strongest, well equal to the Suzerain. To see him twist, bend and even&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except for killing me, though you&rsquo;re welcome to try.&rdquo; Again, that casual smile.</p>
<p>Smirking, Skillen grabbed K&rsquo;rul by the collar, yanked him to the floor with a thomp. The hood dropped back, and he was satisfied to see a flash of horror on K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>He pinned K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s shoulder to the floor with his left hand, flung the cloak away, and tore open K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s shirt. A pale hand reached up to his belt, Skillen pat it firmly aside. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo; He commanded.</p>
<p>K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s hand dropped.</p>
<p>Skillen Droe peeled off K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s breeches from the shapely, slightly thrashing legs. His companion was helplessly naked now, and the room was cold. He heard a crackling sound behind him, and found a fireplace burning merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll begin.&rdquo; He announced.</p>
<p>Skillen Droe ran his fingers along the length of K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s body, and was satisfied to see him shudder and sigh when he touched the ribs, the thighs, the back of one knee. He felt those eyes fix nervously yet fervently on him, and was amazed by how quickly thoughts of violence arose. Grabbing a blindfold from the empty air, he pulled K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s head up by the hair, and tied the cloth with the tightest knot known to the world around K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s head. At a gasp of pain he discovered both of them already solid hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proceed.&rdquo; K&rsquo;rul said calmly, seemingly not troubled by the losing of sight.</p>
<p>He jerked when Skillen Droe pressed his thighs open with his knees. And then Skillen inserted a finger, feeling the flesh tense and ebb around it. With the other hand, he let his trousers fall.</p>
<p>K&rsquo;rul gasped and arched his back. Skillen Droe thrust himself into him, moving to and fro, eliciting yet more gasps and moans. He imagined bruises blossoming on K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s hips and shoulders, wherever his body contacted the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like this?&rdquo; He teased.</p>
<p>K&rsquo;rul smiled, &ldquo;Proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt it come, and spent himself inside his companion, not unsatisfied to find K&rsquo;rul still thrashing. Skillen Droe retreated. K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s hand involuntarily stole to his groin, seeking to relieve himself, but Skillen grabbed him by a bony wrist and pinned it on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He ordered.</p>
<p>K&rsquo;rul sounded close to sobbing when he said, &ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skillen Droe admired at him, the sodden hair and blindfold, the flushing face and blood-stained lips, the biting marks over his neck and chest that he couldn&rsquo;t even register, the projecting elbows and knees, the slim ankles, and the pearly evidence of Skillen&rsquo;s prowess spread over the inner of his thighs. It was astonishing how K&rsquo;rul still clung to a shred of dignity, through his speech and his expressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in your satchel?&rdquo; He demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bottle.&rdquo; Squirmed, &ldquo;Of Thel Akai bloodwine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>He must have planned this.</em> Skillen felt slightly annoyed. He presumed to think that he had defeated K&rsquo;rul, but this seemed all within the latter&rsquo;s expectation. He found ropes on the table, and this time he held K&rsquo;rul by the neck and flung him across the table. K&rsquo;rul squealed.</p>
<p>Skillen Droe bound K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s wrists together, and tied them to a leg of the table. He then tied K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s left ankle to the leg across, but left the other one free. K&rsquo;rul curled his right leg up.</p>
<p>Skillen discovered the bottle quickly enough. When he returned, K&rsquo;rul was desperately tugging at his restraints, to no avail.</p>
<p>He felt, somehow, nervous. K&rsquo;rul, afterall, was an admirable man, and to do this felt near blasphemy. That was a relatively accurate term, since K&rsquo;rul was worshipped in distant lands. He wondered what K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s believers would think if they see him like this.</p>
<p>He conjured a goblet and poured bloodwine into it, and strode to where his companion was tied, cup in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel now?&rdquo; He whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helpless.&rdquo; K&rsquo;rul replied, but his tone was glad.</p>
<p>He expected something else, something near shame, pain, fury. Even if K&rsquo;rul burn those ropes to ashes in this moment and leap from the table to clash with him, he won&rsquo;t be surprised. Yet K&rsquo;rul laid unmoving, tempting and innocent, virgin and whore both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can make you drink.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Thel Akai bloodwine is a potent brew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; K&rsquo;rul hissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t protest me, bound by your own words. But if you plead, I might change my mind, say, I could drink it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which do you prefer?&rdquo; K&rsquo;rul teased.</p>
<p>He pressed the cup to K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s lips, who drank, and step back to watch the wine take effect. The tied Elder God thrashed as wildly as the ropes would let him, moaning, gasping in need.</p>
<p>Skillen Droe surged forward. Although fucking K&rsquo;rul could be fun, he planned for something yet darker. He placed a hand on the sinuous neck, &ldquo;I could well choke you, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo; K&rsquo;rul had not been as lost as he believed him to be, still able to clearly say discernable words.</p>
<p>The hand closed around his neck, K&rsquo;rul gasped a little, but the hand let no air through after that. His legs began to kick involuntarily, his lips turning blue, his eyes rolling wildly behind the blindfold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you surrender yourself?&rdquo; Skillen Droe asked, annoyed and confused, &ldquo;Are you not among the most powerful ones? Isn&rsquo;t power our virtue, our essence? Don&rsquo;t you take offence in my enjoying myself at the expense of you? How do you feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He expected no response, as he continued to choke the man tied to the table. He know it would be hard to kill a powerful being like K&rsquo;rul, yet when given the chance, he was startled to find the thought most alluring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; He asked again, letting himself be infuriated by the absence of an answer.</p>
<p>K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s thrashing weakened, and there were yet more white substance crowding the inner of his thigh. Scowling, Skillen released his hand.</p>
<p>K&rsquo;rul gasped, coughed and tried to curl up, but failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because our pursuit of power had led us astray.&rdquo; He rasped, &ldquo;Skillen Droe, you ask how I feel? I feel dread, I feel anxious, I plan, I guess, I anticipate. That is, I believe, how those without as much power live, a much more vivid way than ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; Skillen frowned, &ldquo;How can you enjoy being fucked, bound, choked to death? If I wish, I could easily sear words on you, I can hang you in the air, I can smash the chair into your brain, I can tear the door from its hinges and drag you out for everyone to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is virtue in being helpless.&rdquo; K&rsquo;rul said, &ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thought dominated him. Skillen Droe grabbed a knife, hovered it over K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s neck. It seemed that K&rsquo;rul had no idea what was about to happen, given that he was blindfolded and everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An experiment?&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;Virtue? Is there virtue in sacrificing your dignity like this, K&rsquo;rul? Is there virtue in being killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is there virtue in taking away others&rsquo; dignity, Skillen?&rdquo; K&rsquo;rul retorted, &ldquo;Is there virtue in killing, if that&rsquo;s what you intend to do? Well, as an experiment I won&rsquo;t allow myself to die, and a knife in my jugular&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrieked when Skillen Droe stabbed.</p>
<p>Skillen didn&rsquo;t remember how many times he had pushed the knife into K&rsquo;rul, the neck, the thigh, between the ribs. His heart had been cold when he did that, knowing that he wouldn&rsquo;t be responsible for anything. He had seen K&rsquo;rul&rsquo;s face go pale, blood frothing on the purple lips, blood, blood, everywhere on the plain table which had now served as an altar.</p>
<p>And suddenly the cottage faded, he stood in the light of day. So was K&rsquo;rul, still naked and bruised and smeared, but no longer bleeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I have said, a knife in my jugular proved insufficient to kill me.&rdquo; He said politely, &ldquo;Thank you, Skillen, for giving a nice try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Skillen muttered. A fountain was born at where the cottage had been, K&rsquo;rul stepped in to cleanse himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look to yourself, Skillen, look what power does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so he watched K&rsquo;rul gather up his clothes. Heard K&rsquo;rul bid him farewell. Staring at the stains of white and red over the slope, Skillen Droe buried his head into his hands and began to weep.</p>
